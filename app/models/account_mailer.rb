#
#  = Email Handler
#
#  This class is used to send all email.  Note that it is just a collection of
#  class methods; it is never instantiated.  It is a subclass of
#  ActionMailer::Base.  See also QueuedEmail for more information about how
#  queuing works and how all the email-related classes and subclasses are
#  related.
#
#  == Class methods

#
#  == Delivery methods
#
#  There are four delivery methods available, configurable in
#  config/environment.rb as:
#
#    config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :method
#
#  Where <tt>:method</tt> is one of these:
#
#  smtp::      Default for production: uses the Net::SMTP ruby library.
#  sendmail::  We've never used this: uses <tt>/usr/sbin/sendmail</tt>.
#  test::      Default for unit tests: ???
#  file::      Default for development: writes emails as files in
#                <tt>RAILS_ROOT/../mail</tt> (if this directory exists).
#
#  == Privacy policy
#
#  Our current policy is that a user's email address is only revealed to people
#  they explicitly send questions to, or to the owner of the observation they
#  comment on. *NOT* to third parties who are simply interested in or who have
#  also commented on the same observation.
