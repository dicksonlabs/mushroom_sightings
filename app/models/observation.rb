#  = Observation Model
#
#  An Observation is a mushroom seen at a certain Location and time, as
#  recorded by a User.  This is at the core of the site.  It can have any
#  number of Image's, Naming's, Comment's, Interest's.
#
#  == Voting
#
#  Voting is still in a state of flux.  At the moment User's create Naming's
#  and other User's Vote on them.  We combine the Vote's for each Naming, cache
#  the Vote for each Naming in the Naming.  However no Naming necessarily wins
#  -- instead Vote's are tallied for each Synonym (see calc_consensus for full
#  details).  Thus the accepted Name of the winning Synonym is cached in the
#  Observation along with its winning Vote score.
#
#  == Location
#
#  An Observation can belong to either a defined Location (+location+, a
#  Location instance) or an undefined one (+where+, just a String), and even
#  occasionally both (see below).  To make this a little easier, you can refer
#  to +place_name+ instead, which returns the name of whichever is present.
#
#  *NOTE*: We were clearly having trouble making up our mind whether or not to
#  set +where+ when +location+ was present.  The only safe heuristic is to use
#  +location+ if it's present, then fall back on +where+ -- +where+ may or may
#  not be set (or even accurate?) if +location+ is present.
#
#  *NOTE*: If a mushroom is seen at a mushroom fair or an herbarium, we don't
#  necessarily know where the mushroom actually grew.  In this case, we enter
#  the mushroom fair / herbarium as the +place_name+ and set the special flag
#  +is_collection_location+ to false.
