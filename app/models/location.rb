#  east::          (V) East edge in degrees east, e.g. -122.173
#  west::          (V) West edge in degrees east, e.g. -122.204
#  high::          (V) Maximum elevation in meters, e.g. 100
#  low::           (V) Minimum elevation in meters, e.g. 0
#  notes::         (V) Arbitrary extra notes supplied by User.
#
#  ('V' indicates that this attribute is versioned in past_locations table.)
#
#  == Class methods
#
#  primer::             List of User's latest Locations to prime auto-completer.
#  clean_name::         Clean a name before doing searches on it.
#
#  == Instance methods
#
#  interests::          Interests in this Location.
#  observations::       Observations at this Location.
#
#  ==== Lat/long methods
#  north_west::         [north, west]
#  north_east::         [north, east]
#  south_west::         [south, west]
#  south_east::         [south, east]

#
#  ==== Name methods
#  display_name::       +name+ reformated based on user's preference.
#  text_name::          Plain-text version of +display_name+.
#  format_name::        Alias for +display_name+ (for compatibility).
#  unique_text_name::   (same thing, with id tacked on to make unique)
#  unique_format_name:: (same thing, with id tacked on to make unique)
#
#  ==== Attachments
#  versions::           Old versions.
#  description::        Main LocationDescription.
#  descriptions::       Alternate LocationDescription's.
#  interests::          Interests in this Location.
#  observations::       Observations using this Location as consensus.
#  mergable?::          Is it safe to merge this Location into another.
