  # Tricky bit of logic to determine what kind of email is being sent here.  If
  # sending comment to owner of object it is not a "response to their comment"
  # -- it is a "comment on their object".  Otherwise if the recipient has also
  # commented on the same object, then it is being sent because it is a
  # response to their comment.  We do not care about the recipient's interest
  # in the object: call it a response if it is a response so long as they are
  # not the owner.  Note, we need to be careful of order of causality: because
  # of queuing, things could get out of order.  For example: A comments, B
  # comments, then A's comment is sent to B.  It is important that B had not
  # yet commented at the time A commented.  This means B is being sent A's
  # comment not because it was a response, but because B is interested in the
  # object being commented on.  Is all this clear?  Sure isn't to me...
  # This is all important because we need to give the user the correct link
  # at the bottom of the email to turn off these sorts of emails.  Turning off
  # email_comments_response will not prevent owner from getting them; turning
  # off email_comments_owner will not prevent non-owner from getting them.
  # Interest confuses the whole issue, of course, since it overrides these
  # two prefs.
