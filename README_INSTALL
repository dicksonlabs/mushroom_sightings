The following are notes I took while setting up a local, self-contained
version of MushroomObserver.org on an installation of Ubuntu 6.10, Edgy Eft.
Please send us an updated version of this document if you find errors or
differences for your platform of choice.  Feel free to get in touch if you
get stuck.

Get software using Synaptic Package Manager
(System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager)
  Ruby (1.8.4 - Ubuntu)
  MySQL (Ver 14.12 Distrib 5.0.24a - Ubuntu)
  svn (version 1.3.2 (r19776) - Ubuntu)
  ImageMagick (6.2.4 - Ubuntu)

Downloaded rubygems from rubyonrails.com (0.9.1) [No synaptic package]
  shell> cd <gems-dir>
  shell> sudo ruby setup.rb

Rails: (first tried synaptic package, but got complaints)
  shell> sudo gem install rails --include-dependencies # 1.2.1

RedCloth: (ruby gem for doing simplified markup)
  shell> sudo gem install RedCloth
  
Setup MySQL
The Ubuntu Synaptic install got alot of stuff running.  The server was
already running and it automatically restarts after a reboot.

Couldn't get the User Administration section of MySQL Administrator
to work for me, so reverted to raw mysql:
  shell> mysql -u root

Secured automatically created accounts:
  mysql> select user, host from mysql.user;
  mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR '<user>'@'<host>' = PASSWORD('<newpwd>');

Get Mushroom Observer source
  shell> svn checkout http://svn.collectivesource.com/mushroom_sightings/trunk

Create database.yml from database.yml-template
  shell> cd trunk/config
  shell> cp database.yml-template database.yml

Edit the passwords in database.yml.  You can also change the usernames
  and databases if you want, but the rest of this will assume the names
  in the template.  I needed to change the socket: line as well as documented
  in the template.  Other options include /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock and /tmp/mysql.sock.

Create databases:
  shell> mysql -u root -p
  mysql> create database observer_development;
  mysql> create database observer_test;
  mysql> create database observer_production;

Create 'mo' user:
  mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP,ALTER,LOCK TABLES on observer_development.* to 'mo'@'localhost' identified by '<password>';
  mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP,ALTER,LOCK TABLES on observer_test.* to 'mo'@'localhost' identified by '<password>';
  mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP,ALTER,LOCK TABLES on observer_production.* to 'mo'@'localhost' identified by '<password>';

Test user:
  shell> mysql -u mo -p observer_development

Create environment.rb from environment.rb-template:
  shell> cp environment.rb-template environment.rb

  If you want to test email, you'll need to edit environment.rb and provide
  a username and password, but otherwise you can leave it as it is.

Setup image directories:
  shell> cd ../public/images
  shell> mkdir 640 orig thumb
  
Setup .htaccess
  shell> cd ..
  shell> ln -s .htaccess-dev .htaccess

Get database checkpoint and corresponding images
  <need to work on this>

Load database:
  shell> cd ..
  shell> mysql -u mo -p observer_development
  mysql> source db/checkpoints/checkpoint

Update the database:
  shell> rake db:migrate
  
Start server:
  shell> script/server

Point web browser at:
  http://localhost:3000
