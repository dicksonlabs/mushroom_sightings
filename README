The following are notes I took while setting up a local, self-contained
version of MushroomObserver.org on an installation of Ubuntu 6.10, Edgy Eft.

Get software using Synaptic Package Manager
(System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager)
  Ruby (1.8.4 - Ubuntu)
  MySQL (Ver 14.12 Distrib 5.0.24a - Ubuntu)
  svn (version 1.3.2 (r19776) - Ubuntu)
  ImageMagick (6.2.4 - Ubuntu)

Downloaded rubygems from rubyonrails.com (0.9.1) [No synaptic package]
  shell> cd <gems-dir>
  shell> sudo ruby setup.rb

Rails: (first tried synaptic package, but got complaints)
  shell> sudo gem install rails --include-dependencies # 1.2.1


Setup MySQL
The Ubuntu Synaptic install got alot of stuff running.  The server was
already running and it automatically restarts after a reboot.

Couldn't get the User Administration section of MySQL Administrator
to work for me, so reverted to raw mysql:
  shell> mysql -u root

Secured automatically created accounts:
  mysql> select user, host from mysql.user;
  mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR '<user>'@'<host>' = PASSWORD('<newpwd>');

Get Mushroom Observer source
  shell> svn checkout http://svn.collectivesource.com/mushroom_sightings/

Create database.yml from database.yml-template
  shell> cd mushroom_sightings/trunk/config
  shell> cp database.yml-template database.yml

Edit the passwords in database.yml.  You can also change the usernames
  and databases if you want, but the rest of this will assume the names
  in the template.  I need to change the socket: line as well as documented
  in the template.

Create databases:
  shell> mysql -u root -p
  mysql> create database observer_development;
  mysql> create database observer_test;
  mysql> create database observer_production;

Create 'mo' user:
  mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP,ALTER,LOCK TABLES on observer_development.* to 'mo'@'localhost' identified by '<password>';
  mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP,ALTER,LOCK TABLES on observer_test.* to 'mo'@'localhost' identified by '<password>';
  mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP,ALTER,LOCK TABLES on observer_production.* to 'mo'@'localhost' identified by '<password>';

Test user:
  shell> mysql -u mo -p observer_development

Create environment.rb from environment.rb-template:
  shell> cp environment.rb-template environment.rb

  If you want to test email, you'll need to edit environment.rb and provide
  a username and password, but otherwise you can leave it as it is.

Setup .htaccess
  shell> cd ../public
  shell> ln -s .htaccess-dev .htaccess

Get database checkpoint and corresponding images
  <need to work on this>

Load database:
  shell> cd ..
  shell> mysql -u mo -p observer_development
  mysql> source db/checkpoints/checkpoint

Start server:
  shell> script/server

Point web browser at:
  http://localhost:3000
