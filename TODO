List window still gets scrunched under Safari

Bug from adding data:  Is this fixable?
  Manage Images when alternating between two FireFox tabs (splitting an existing observation seems to be a good test case - e.g., observation 388) - Confusion between which observation is 'current' in each tab
     show 1, show 2, manage 1 goes to 2


Add Calivatia booniana (2005/07-03/Photos/HPIM1251.JPG) [2006-06-26]

----------

Replace rss to use rss_log rather than rss_event

Implement observer/log?<number>

release email options and new RSS feed

Testing suite for rss_log

----------

most recent should be based on RSS
More image oriented display (larger thumbnails on observation page, next/prev for images)
image titles should go away

----------

More color themes: Boletus

More rails-style tests

next/prev links for images

Add support for uploading Name species lists

Field based search mechanism

user pages

Names - Replace the 'what' field with an association with a list of 'Name' objects.
  Name objects would allow for things like author citations, synonymy, references, descriptions etc.

Use names to support real species lists

Namings - Provide a formalized way for users to associate a 'Name' with an 'Observation'.

Hook 'where' up to Google Maps

Provide the ability to create an observation as a side effect of uploading an image
  rather than requiring the observation to exist before allowing image upload.

Herbarium records - Provide a standard way to describe herbarium collections.

show_observation pages could have pagination_links instead of next/prev links.

Check for duplicate images, image garbage collection

New ideas:
Mycology club affiliations (useful for searching)
Copying species lists
Local client that can only add
Provide a strong image focus option
Summary pages for higher level taxa (somewhat related to field based search)
