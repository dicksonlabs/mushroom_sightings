Checklists
    Process data
    - Make sure data persists when missing required data, new names are given or multiples
    - Track down bad ids after selecting Latest Changes - 621, 743, 745
    - Correctly checklist entered species if more dialog is needed
      params[:checklist_names][id] indicates if the given name is selected ("true", "false")
      session[checklist] lists [observation_name, id]
    - Deal with exhaustive checklists more efficiently
      - Add upload_species_list functionality
    - Should some pages reset session['checklist'] and/or 'observation_ids'?
    - Review behavior with Edit Species List
    - Figure out a way to merge species lists
    Select All (like 'Save' with missing required value) [enables copying species lists]
    
Simple search by location.
