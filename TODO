Current task:

Enable internationalization/localization with Brazilian Portuguese as the example
  - Incorporate the first set of phrases
  - Make them visible based on browser setting
  - Fix year select issue with create observation in Portuguese
  - Threadish issue that Darvin reported
  - Ask Everaldo and Lu about news
  Translate .rhtml templates for account and observer
  Add user setting to preferences
  Figure out how to correctly translate emails (account_mailer/*.rhtml)
  Encourage other users to provide translations
  Should the following be translated?
    [:Form, :Variety, :Subspecies, :Species, :Genus, :Family, :Order, :Class, :Phylum, :Kingdom, :Group]

*** Improve 'where'
  location:
    where (string)

    lat1
    lat2
    long1

  lat/long finder
  Hook up to Google Maps
  Future ideas:
    Explicit error and/or 'secretness'
    Shape information from Darwin Core

Large features:

** Namings
  Provide a formalized way for users to associate a 'Name' with an 'Observation'.
      Add confidence level for a naming
      Add basis for naming (macroscopic, key, references, microscopic, chemical, genetic)
      Allow users to select among proposed ids or indicate that none of them seem right.
      Provide an easy way to add a comment at the same time.
  data:
    Namings:
      name_id
      user
      when
      notes

    Opinion:
      naming_id
      user
      confidence
      notes

    Confidence:
      No opinion
      Strongly agree
      Agree
      Could be
      Not sure
      Seems unlikely
      Disagree
      Strongly disagree

    Image opinion:
      image_id
      scientific_value
      asthetic_value
      notes

** Checklists - Lists of Names that have a Title and Purpose, but no associated Observations.
    Can be used to create species lists, or simply displayed and copied for publication somewhere else.
    Use to create a single observation
    Dynamic checklists - click for completions (ajaxify?)

** Herbarium records - Provide a standard way to describe herbarium collections.

** Higher-level taxa (Agaricus is part of Agaricales, etc.)
      View members and membership
      Page of all members and below?
      Should Macrolepiota include Chlorophyllum rachodes?
      Add rank relationships from Name

** Mobile phone support
    - Figure out how to tell the difference
    Look up on web for mobile support functions
    Mobilize layout:
        MO & Title on one line.
        Push around the divs
        Create a single link at the top for to go to the left-hand panel with the search buttons
        Remove pagination links from the top of the page
    Ability to receive observations through email

* High-bandwith support - 1024x768 suggested rather than 640x640 max.

* Name tagging
    Some obvious tags: rare, uncommon, common, edible, choice, inedible, toxic, deadly, medicinal, hallucinogenic
    Some less obvious tags: 'slime mold', 'hypogeous'...
    Planning on both simple tags (<name> is <tag>) and full RDF support (<name> has <predicate> <value>):
      E.g. "Boletus edulis" is "choice" and "Boletus edulis" has "edibility" of "choice"

* Dynamic checklist: Enter the first part of a name "Ama" and ask for completions.  You can ask for completions
  for "", but it will be slow.  Leads to the idea of caching the list as html since the set of names doesn't change that
  often.

* Mycology club affiliations (useful for searching)

* Summary pages for higher level taxa (somewhat related to field based search)

* Machine identification
    Need to check out Symbiota: http://seinet.asu.edu/seinet/symbiota/index.php

Notifications
    Users could register interest in a particular name and get email when one shows up.
    Add RSS feeds for searches, names, higher level taxa
    Let collector know if someone has asked for collections

Foreign language support

Yet more stuff to do with Names
    Common Name support (== Group but without the group)
    Spelling correction
    References
    Descriptions

Use RDF to make data machine readable
    Could be used to enable identification

Add support for OpenID

Field based search mechanism

General discussion blog that is searchable

Local client that can only add



Small features:

+* Show all comments

+* Hide name changes from default page?  There's been debate about whether this is worth the added complexity.
  Might be handled by having a toggle that says 'More images'/'Less images' this would also change
    the layout to rows with all the thumbs displayed

+ Deprecate/Approve should have a comment field.

Synonym features
  Automated way to apply synonyms to your own observations (with review)

Admin stuff:
    Pages for accessing the logs

Contribution
    Hidden contributors
    Contribution adjustment?
    Contribution by month?
    Better design?

More user collection pages?
  User Comments
  User Images
  User Species Lists

User pages
    User.where (optional)
    User roles/permissions
        [Mushroom God - Mycorhizzal + login and database password]
        Mycorhizzal - Lichenized + update site, become another user, send feature email
        Lichenized - Composter + change the status of others (up to Lichenized), SVN access
        Composter - Ranking, new submissions, name editing, mailing list, edit own entries
        Parasite - No ranking, no new submissions, no name editing, mailing list, edit own entries
        Extinct - No ranking, no new submissions, no name editing, no mailing list, cannot edit own entries

Split up observer_controller?:
    user pages
    non-user pages?
    email delivery

Mechanism for merging species lists?

Page for Unknowns

NaME file loads don't preserve datestamp?
Name comments rather than just notes?

Add user.login and what got changed to show_past_name

Check for duplicate images, image garbage collection

More color themes: Boletus, Coprinus (very black and white)
