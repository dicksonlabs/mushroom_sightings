       can use: require 'session' for separating stdout/stderr
    move dbpict logic over to image class

  - Cleanup list_images
  - edit_image should show the image
  - link to get_image rather than new_image
  - clean up show_image
  - image resizing isn't working right for vertical images
  - Reset database and images
  - Get Add Image on Edit Observation working
    * join table working
    * Need to display join info as thumbnails in show_observation and edit_observation

  - Set thumbnail to first image
  - Thumbnail for list_observations.
  - Use radio buttons to Select Thumbnail in Edit Observation
  - Expanded year selection for 'When'
