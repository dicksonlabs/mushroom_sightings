  Relationships between locations: Would like to be able to find all collections in Yuba Co., etc.
  Should collections have individual lat/longs?

Clean up Next/Prev when used with the Back button.  Possibly rename Next/Prev

** Namings (Jason's active task)
  Provide a formalized way for users to associate a 'Name' with an 'Observation'.
      Add confidence level for a naming
      Add basis for naming (macroscopic, key, references, microscopic, chemical, genetic)
      Allow users to select among proposed ids or indicate that none of them seem right.
      Provide an easy way to add a comment at the same time.

** Enable internationalization/localization with Brazilian Portuguese as the example
    - Incorporate the first set of phrases
    - Make them visible based on browser setting
    - Fix year select issue with create observation in Portuguese
    - Threadish issue that Darvin reported
    - Ask Everaldo and Lu about news
    Translate .rhtml templates for account and observer (on hold waiting for translations)
    Add user setting to preferences
    Figure out how to correctly translate emails (account_mailer/*.rhtml)
    Encourage other users to provide translations

* Theme editor (Jason has an almost complete prototype)
    More color themes: Boletus, Coprinus (very black and white)


Large features:

*** Checklists - Lists of Names that have a Title and Purpose/notes, but no associated Observations.
    Can be used to create species lists, or simply displayed and copied for publication somewhere else.
    Use to create observations
    Dynamic checklists based on location or user

** Projects - Create a pages for describing proposed research projects.  Projects will have a public page
    and a private page.  Each will have a principle investigator (PI) who controls who can see the private page.
    The project pages will have an associated Species List (of Observations relevant to the project) and an
    associated Checklist (of Names relevant to the project).  In addition there will be a set of documents
    associated with the project that can be marked as either public or private.  Only people approved by the
    PI are allowed to see the private documents, but anyone can see the public ones as well as the list of
    Observations and Names.

** Herbarium records - Provide a standard way to describe herbarium collections.

** Higher-level taxa (Agaricus is part of Agaricales, etc.)
      View members and membership
      Page of all members and below?
      Should Macrolepiota include Chlorophyllum rachodes?
      Add rank relationships from Name

** Mobile phone support
    - Figure out how to tell the difference
    Look up on web for mobile support functions
    Mobilize layout:
        MO & Title on one line.
        Push around the divs
        Create a single link at the top for to go to the left-hand panel with the search buttons
        Remove pagination links from the top of the page
    Ability to receive observations through email

* High-bandwith support - 1024x768 suggested rather than 640x640 max.

* Name tagging
    Some obvious tags: rare, uncommon, common, edible, choice, inedible, toxic, deadly, medicinal, hallucinogenic
    Some less obvious tags: 'slime mold', 'hypogeous'...
    Planning on both simple tags (<name> is <tag>) and full RDF support (<name> has <predicate> <value>):
      E.g. "Boletus edulis" is "choice" and "Boletus edulis" has "edibility" of "choice"

* Dynamic checklist: Enter the first part of a name "Ama" and ask for completions.  You can ask for completions
  for "", but it will be slow.  Leads to the idea of caching the list as html since the set of names doesn't change that
  often.

* Mycology club affiliations (useful for searching)

* Summary pages for higher level taxa (somewhat related to field based search)

* Machine identification
    Need to check out Symbiota: http://seinet.asu.edu/seinet/symbiota/index.php

Owned descriptions
    Right now anyone can edit any part of any description for a Name.  It would be nice if there was a community
    description and a set of owned descriptions.

Notifications
    Users could register interest in a particular name and get email when one shows up.
    Add RSS feeds for searches, names, higher level taxa
    Let collector know if someone has asked for collections

Foreign language support

Yet more stuff to do with Names
    Common Name support (== Group but without the group)
    Spelling correction
    References
    Descriptions

Use RDF to make data machine readable
    Could be used to enable identification

Add support for OpenID

Field based search mechanism

General discussion blog that is searchable

Local client that can only add



Small features:

+* Hide name changes from default page?  There's been debate about whether this is worth the added complexity.
  Might be handled by having a toggle that says 'More images'/'Less images' this would also change
    the layout to rows with all the thumbs displayed

More location and user links:
Map of all locations

Rename 'Features and Fixes' to include Date and version

Create species list location should be ajaxified

Synonym features
  Automated way to apply synonyms to your own observations (with review)

Admin stuff:
    Webpages for accessing the logs

Top ten pages of Names, Images, Observations
    Names: Best Edibles, Most Toxic, Hallucinogenic, Easiest to Learn, Easiest to Confuse ...
    Images: Pictorial, Scientific, Humor, ...
    Observations: Biggest, Smallest, Off season, Surprising
    Ideally users should be able to create new top ten pages and the top ten pages themselves should get ranked somehow

Contribution
    Hidden contributors
    Contribution adjustment?
    Contribution by month?
    Better design?

More user collection pages?
  User Comments

        Composter - Ranking, new submissions, name editing, mailing list, edit own entries
        Parasite - No ranking, no new submissions, no name editing, mailing list, edit own entries
        Extinct - No ranking, no new submissions, no name editing, no mailing list, cannot edit own entries

Split up observer_controller?:

Mechanism for merging species lists?

Page for Unknowns

NaME file loads don't preserve datestamp?
