Names - Replace the 'what' field with an association with a list of 'Name' objects.
  Name objects would allow for things like author citations, synonymy, references, descriptions etc.
  Targets:
    Name pages
      names -> id, type, name, author
    Spelling correction
    Author citations
    References
    Synonymy
    Descriptions

Use names to support real species lists

Namings - Provide a formalized way for users to associate a 'Name' with an 'Observation'.
  Add confidence level for a naming
  Add basis for naming (sight, key, references)

Improve search functions:
Make search box more available.
  Easy for non-form pages like show_*
  Should it be universal?  How will that interact with form pages (edit_*)?
  Should results go in a new window or tab?
Field based search mechanism [douglas]

General discussion blog that is searchable

Improve 'where'
  lat, long, altitude
  Hook up to Google Maps

user pages

Provide the ability to create an observation as a side effect of uploading an image
  rather than requiring the observation to exist before allowing image upload.

Herbarium records - Provide a standard way to describe herbarium collections.

show_observation pages could have pagination_links instead of next/prev links.

Check for duplicate images, image garbage collection


Need to revise how species lists are handled to allow for chronological notes, but cumulative lists.  See:
http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/show_species_list/8

Do rss_log lists need Next/Prev?

More color themes: Boletus, Coprinus (very black and white)

More rails-style tests


New ideas:
Mycology club affiliations (useful for searching)
Copying species lists
Local client that can only add
Provide a strong image focus option
Summary pages for higher level taxa (somewhat related to field based search)
