Names - Replace the 'what' field with an association with a list of 'Name' objects.
  Name objects would allow for things like author citations, synonymy, references, descriptions etc.
  Targets:
    Name pages
      - Name table
      - Data creation
		- Create all genera
	  - Hook up to Observation
	  - spread textilize_without_paragraph [check completeness]
	  - separate semantics of unique_name (h vs. textilize)
	    unique_text_name - h
	    text_name - h
	    format_name - textilize h
	    unique_format_name - textilize h
	  - show_name page
	    observation list should be like show_species_list - images, and prev/next links should get setup
	    should order be based on RSS log dates, modified or when - modified
	  - name_index to replace observation_index, display rank
	  - edit_name
	  - tracking changes
	    - showing history
	Deprecate Observation.what
	  - fix search
	  - fix edit_observation
	    - option to create new name
	    - bug 'Amanita baccata sensu Borealis' changed 'Amanita baccata sensu Arora' rather
	      than creating a new name.
	    - select from multiples
	  fix process_simple_list, process_name_list, construct_observation (species_list.rb)
	    - deal with new names in update_species_list
	    - deal with multiple names in update_species_list
	    update create_species_list
	      - Newly created Observations aren't getting their 'When' set
	      - Get multiple names working with new_species_list/create_species_list
	      - Get and member notes to propagate through the session
	      - process_simple_list, process_name_list
	      - Integrate the session technique into update_species_list
	      - Testing:
	        New members and multiple members:
    	        - Create new list
    	          - when not getting set
    	        - Add to list
    	        - Load simple species list
    	        - Load Name list
    	    New members
    	    Multiple members
    	      - 2x Amanita baccata gives two sets of linked radio buttons
    	    Existing singles
    - Species list log entries getting thrashed
    - Creating new Names without an observation or species list
    - Creation and modification dates on Names
    - Ability to update author through Species list mechanism
    
    Eliminate Observation.what
    Fix author parsing
    Common Name? (== Group but without the group, foreign language?)
	Grouping
	  View members and membership
	  Page of all members and below?
	Better management of name clashes
    Spelling correction
    Author citations
    References
    Synonymy
	Deprecating names
    Descriptions

Name lists don't preserve datestamp
Name comments

Add user.login and what got changed to show_past_name
Add option for adding author during species list evaluation

Use names to support real species lists

Namings - Provide a formalized way for users to associate a 'Name' with an 'Observation'.
  Add confidence level for a naming
  Add basis for naming (sight, key, references)

Improve search functions:
Make search box more available.
  Easy for non-form pages like show_*
  Should it be universal?  How will that interact with form pages (edit_*)?
  Should results go in a new window or tab?
Field based search mechanism [douglas]

General discussion blog that is searchable

Improve 'where'
  lat, long, altitude
  Hook up to Google Maps

user pages

Foreign language support

Provide the ability to create an observation as a side effect of uploading an image
  rather than requiring the observation to exist before allowing image upload.

Herbarium records - Provide a standard way to describe herbarium collections.

show_observation pages could have pagination_links instead of next/prev links.

Check for duplicate images, image garbage collection


Need to revise how species lists are handled to allow for chronological notes, but cumulative lists.  See:
http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/show_species_list/8

Do rss_log lists need Next/Prev?

More color themes: Boletus, Coprinus (very black and white)

More rails-style tests


New ideas:
Mycology club affiliations (useful for searching)
Copying species lists
Local client that can only add
Provide a strong image focus option
Summary pages for higher level taxa (somewhat related to field based search)
