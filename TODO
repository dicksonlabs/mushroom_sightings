Current task:

*** Provide support for multiple licenses.
    Initial target is to allow the image owner to choose between a non-commercial Creative Commons license
     and Wikipedia compatible licenses:
  GFDL & CC-by-sa (To allow images to be used on Wikipedia)
  CC-by-nc-sa (Disallow commercial use)
  Stored on a per image basis (wiki, nc2.5, nc3)
  User preferences for default
  Need global update mechanism.  Do update on a per distinct copyright basis rather than as a completely global user basis.
  Pages:
    - _form_ccbyncsa25.rhtml
    - _form_ccbyncsa30.rhtml
    - _form_ccbysa30.rhtml
    - show_image (display appropriate license info)
    - show_original (display appropriate license info)
    edit_image (change the license for this image)
    add_image (select starting license)
    prefs (user specified default for add_image)
    add license_updater off of prefs (allows license change by copyright)
