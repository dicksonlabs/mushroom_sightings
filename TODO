Release each of the following as they get completed:

Clean up Next/Prev when used with the Back button.  Possibly rename Next/Prev.  Make home page list the default. (16)
  Switch list to store small state
    State: current id, next id, prev id, current index
      To be added: type [observation, name, image, location], sql conditions, sql ordering,
    - General Search
      - Next/Prev starting from RSS Log page
        - URL key that maps into session
      - next/prev_observation for multiple RSS Log starts
      - pagination links working across multiple tabs
      - next/prev observation after searching for 'Cantharelllus'
      - next/prev observation for searches in separate tabs
      
      next/prev_image
        Use cases:
          - image search
          show_image after observation list
        ./controllers/image_controller.rb
        ./views/image/show_image.rhtml
      tests for next/prev image/observation with data
        Image sequence from an observation sequence should be independent of the observation sequence
          Testing.
          Current solution doesn't feel very clean.  How does params[:obs] get generalized for other cross types?
          Need both search_seq and seq_key so image sequence can be independent of the observation sequence

      get rid of observation_ids
        - ./controllers/image_controller.rb
        - ./views/image/show_image.rhtml
        - ./views/image/reuse_image.rhtml
        - ./controllers/comment_controller.rb
        - ./controllers/name_controller.rb
        - ./controllers/observer_controller.rb
        - ./controllers/species_list_controller.rb
        - ./views/observer/show_observation.rhtml
        - show_name? - move to later if not supported
    
      - do checklists still work?  Probably not.  species_list_controller/calc_checklist - Disabled
      list_rss_logs -> show_observation -> show_image -> next (off into the weeds)
      review allocation of search and sequence states
      review database interaction
      
      later:
        sort by modified, created, when, name, location, observer, mod year (time of year)
        Add next/prev_location
        Add next/prev_name?
      
    list_rss_logs sets the sql conditions and ordering
    show_observation sets the type and current_id
  Manage multiple states

User profile - paragraph available in preferences that gets displayed on the show_user page (4)
  Associate a user with a location (2)
  User photo (4)

Updating an author citation currently requires visiting each observation and adding the new name.  Seems like there should be a simpler way.

Hypholoma aurantiacum recognizes that it is deprecated, but doesn't suggest a valid synonym.

Potentially interesting features for improving amateur/professional communication:

% Notifications
    Email queuing (32)
    Users could register interest in a particular name and get email when one shows up.
    Add RSS feeds for searches, names, higher level taxa (16)
    Add more events to the feed (Locations, Votes, New Users), but add filters for the main page.
      E.g., Observations, Observations with Images, Species Lists, Locations, Votes, Consensus Changing Votes etc.
      The filters would be controllable in the user preferences and would default to "Observations with Images" (24)
    Let collector know if someone has asked for collections (call for specimens) (8)

% Advice on creating collections (4)

% Projects - Create a pages for describing proposed research projects.  Projects will have a public page
    and a private page.  Each will have a principle investigator (PI) who controls who can see the private page.
    The project pages will have an associated Species List (of Observations relevant to the project) and an
    associated Checklist (of Names relevant to the project).  In addition there will be a set of documents
    associated with the project that can be marked as either public or private.  Only people approved by the
    PI are allowed to see the private documents, but anyone can see the public ones as well as the list of
    Observations and Names. (40)

% Higher-level taxa (Agaricus is part of Agaricales, etc.)
      View members and membership
      Page of all members and below?
      Should Macrolepiota include Chlorophyllum rachodes?
      Add rank relationships from Name

%? Owned descriptions (32)
    Right now anyone can edit any part of any description for a Name.  It would be nice if there was a community
    description and a set of owned descriptions.
  
%? Common name support. (40)

%? Hierarchical locations (40)

--------

Theme editor (Jason has an almost complete prototype) (40?)
    More color themes: Boletus, Coprinus (very black and white)

Data to incorporate:
    Rod's A.c. locations (4)
    Mike Davis Russulas (8)
    Ian Gibson Descriptions (16)
    MykoWeb interface (40)
    MushroomHobby interface (24)
    Locations (on going)
    Descriptions (on going)

Image improvements:
  Make it easier to add and see image notes.  Image notes should be visible on show_observation page.  Maybe with a link to add a note. (16)
  Image rating for 'Pictorial', 'Scientific', 'Just Because' (40)
  textarea under or beside each file in the upload page, so you can add notes to individual photos. (8)

Improve caching and Javascript awareness

Organize user preferences into logical groups (8)
  
Featured Mushroom pages (8)

Checklists - Lists of Names that have a Title and Purpose/notes, but no associated Observations. (40)
    Can be used to create species lists, or simply displayed and copied for publication somewhere else.
    Use to create observations
    Dynamic checklists based on location or user
    
    Feedback from Doug Smith on species lists:
    Mostly the feature I need to be able to make 20-100 observations
    all with the same location and date info., based on an existing
    species list that I have.

    One thing is that after that to apply photos to the list there
    is a lot of check back and forth, and that takes awhile.  And
    click back to the list can be troublesome, for some of these
    lists have almost 600 observations now, and getting that many
    observations onto the one page with thumbs takes awhile to 
    download.  Which adds a good few seconds to each clicking back
    and forth.

Sort by date (mod year) (16)
      Sort order pulldown.  Sort by time mod year.

    - Figure out how to tell the difference
    Look up on web for mobile support functions
    Mobilize layout:
        MO & Title on one line.
        Push around the divs
        Create a single link at the top for to go to the left-hand panel with the search buttons
        Remove pagination links from the top of the page
    Ability to receive observations through email

High-bandwith support - 1024x768 suggested rather than 640x640 max. (should include image cleanup) (16)
  Check for duplicate images, check for referenced images
  Provide download link for images in non-standard formats (e.g., TIF)

Name tagging (40)
    Some obvious tags: rare, uncommon, common, edible, choice, inedible, toxic, deadly, medicinal, hallucinogenic
    Some less obvious tags: 'slime mold', 'hypogeous'...
    Planning on both simple tags (<name> is <tag>) and full RDF support (<name> has <predicate> <value>):
      E.g. "Boletus edulis" is "choice" and "Boletus edulis" has "edibility" of "choice"
