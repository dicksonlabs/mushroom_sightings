First public release

User preference for hiding observations with no images?

Bug from adding data:  Is this fixable?
  Manage Images when alternating between two FireFox tabs (splitting an existing observation seems to be a good test case - e.g., observation 388) - Confusion between which observation is 'current' in each tab
     show 1, show 2, manage 1 goes to 2

More color themes: Boletus

Check for duplicate images, image garbage collection

Provide the ability to create an observation as a side effect of uploading an image
  rather than requiring the observation to exist before allowing image upload.

Names - Replace the 'what' field with an association with a list of 'Name' objects.
  Name objects would allow for things like author citations, synonymy, references etc.

Namings - Provide a formalized way for users to associate a 'Name' with an 'Observation'.

Herbarium records - Provide a standard way to describe herbarium collections.
