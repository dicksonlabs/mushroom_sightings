# observer/advanced_search
advanced_search_at_least_one: Please provide at least one search parameter
advanced_search_caveat: >
  Advanced search was added in February, 2009 to [:app_title].  There are
  a lot of directions this feature could go.  I have intentionally kept it
  somewhat limited since I am concerned that it may have performance issues
  that result in timeouts.  Please send "email to the
  webmaster":/observer/ask_webmaster_question if you experience timeouts or if
  there are particular types of searches you would like to have added.
  \n\n
  Hints: It's okay to leave some of the fields blank, e.g., if you leave
  'Observer' blank, it will return results by all [:users].
  It matches the exact string given.  Use "OR" (all caps) to tell it to match
  one of several possible strings, e.g. "Xanthoria OR Xanthomendoza".  Use a
  star as a wildcard, e.g. "Wells Gray*Canada" will match "Wells Gray, Canada",
  "Wells Gray Park, Canada", and "Wells Gray Provincial Park, Canada".  (See
  notes under 'Content', too.)

# observer/color_themes
color_themes_text: >
  **General Concept:** The [:app_title] website provides a number of color
  themes based on different groups of mushrooms.  By default each page gets a
  randomly selected theme.  However, a [:user] can choose to use a particular
  theme throughout the site by selecting the theme on the [:user] preference page.
  \n\n
  The idea of using mushrooms for color follows in the tradition of using
  mushrooms to dye fabrics.  Each color in a theme was pulled from a photograph
  included in the site from the given group.  The colors attempt to express the
  characteristic colors of the group.  In a few cases, the [:images] were adjusted
  using an automatic color balance operation in order to get a more
  characteristic color.
  \n\n
  The following links describe each of the available themes including links to
  the [:images] the colors were extracted from:

eol_preview_explanation: >
  This page provides links to or shows the content that is currently scheduled
  for delivery to the "Encyclopedia of Life":http://eol.org (EOL).  The
  features related to this effort are still very new and far from polished
  since it has been implemented quickly to meet the immediate needs to develop
  the fungus related content on the EOL.  The content delivered from
  [:app_title] to the EOL will be credited both as coming from the [:app_title]
  website and the individual content providers.
  \n\n
  On this page each section represents one taxon.  The descriptive paragraphs
  for each listed taxon will be sent with the exception of any paragraphs
  marked 'Notes'.  Both the taxa and the images that are being sent have been
  at least quickly reviewed by expert members of the [:app_title]
  community.
  \n\n
  The review status of a specific taxon is given on the page for that taxon and
  can only be set by a designated expert.  Images are selected based on the
  voting history of specific observations and their quality.  Currently only
  designated experts can set the quality level of an image, but this is
  expected to become a open voting process for the entire [:app_title]
  community in the near future.
  \n\n
  Currently the designated experts are either mycology professors that are
  teaching classes that are planning to provide data to EOL through the
  [:app_title] or individuals in the [:app_title] community who have
  shown dedication to the site and are recognized experts in mushroom or fungal
  identification.  All aspect of the process of providing data to EOL are under
  discussion and open to change so please send any questions or comments you
  have to the [:app_title] webmaster.
  \n\n
  The best way to participate in this amazing opportunity is to find a taxon
  you care about and work to expand the descriptive paragraphs for this taxon.

  Each line indicates a set of changes.

  p(bulk_text). To ensure a name is in the database, just list the name.  E.g.,
  \n\n
  p(bulk_pre). Agaricus bisporus
  \n\n
  p(bulk_text). To ensure a name exists with a particular author, give the name
  followed by the author.  E.g.,
  \n\n
  p(bulk_pre). Agaricus bisporus (J.E. Lange) Pilát
  \n\n
  p(bulk_text). To add a taxon above the species level, give the rank followed
  by the name.  E.g.,
  \n\n
  p(bulk_pre). Order Agaricales
  \n\n
  p(bulk_text). To make a name a deprecated synonym of another name, follow
  the valid name with the deprecated synonym.  E.g.,
  \n\n
  p(bulk_pre). Agaricus bisporus (J.E. Lange) Pilát = Agaricus hortensis (Cke.)
  Imai
  \n\n
  The changes are cumulative, so the last example by itself would ensure that
  the names **__@Agaricus bisporus@__** @(J.E. Lange) Pilát@ and __@Agaricus
  hortensis@__ @(Cke.) Imai@ exist, as well as making __@A. hortensis@__ a
  deprecated synononym of **__@A. bisporus@__**.  If a name exists with no
  author and you provide an author, then the existing name is updated.
  Otherwise, if the author is given and it does not match the current author, a
  new name is created.
  \n\n
  p(bulk_text). You may include an optional one-line comment by inserting it
  after either the accepted or deprecated name, enclosed in square brackets.
  This will be saved in the notes when the name is created.

  Use the following conditions to narrow down your query results.  Only the
  fields in boldface are required (if any).  Results must match all of the
  conditions that are not left blank.  Many of the conditions accept a range or
  allow multiple values.  Syntax can be complicated; click on the
  [:refine_search_help] tags next to the fields for pointers on what kind of
  values are accepted.

refine_search_confidence_help: >
  This refers to the average confidence of the community to the current
  consensus name of the observation.

refine_search_content_types_help: >
  All reduced sizes are JPEGs.  This only applies to the original image.  Most
  users upload JPEGs, however a small percentage are in other formats.

  Restrict to names with drafts for these project(s).

refine_search_desc_type_help: >
  Restrict to names with descriptions of these type(s).

refine_search_google_help: >
  Enter one word or phrase at a time.  Each time you update the form you will
  see all the previous entries, and you will get another empty field.  Records
  must match each line you have filled in.  If you enter a minus sign as the
  first letter, it will require that the subsequent word or phrase NOT be
  present, e.g., "-Joe Public".  You may list alternatives with the special
  word "OR" in all caps, e.g., "red OR pink OR orange".  Records must contain
  at least one of these alternatives.  Unlike on the google search bar,
  double-quotes are unnecessary for grouping words into a phrase here.  For
  example, this does what you'd expect: "Agaricus sp. OR Leucoagaricus sp.".

refine_search_is_col_loc_help: ""
refine_search_is_deprecated_help: ""
refine_search_join_desc_help: >
  The fields below require that names be joined with their descriptions.  There
  are two ways this can be done: (1) You may join with just the default
  description, in which case the following fields will only apply to the
  default description and will automatically restrict the results to names that
  actually have a default description.  (2) You may also join with all of a
  name's descriptions, in which case the following fields can apply to any
  description.  This will only restrict the results to names that have
  descriptions, not just names with a default one.

refine_search_license_help: ""
refine_search_location_defined_help: >
  Enter name or id of a location.  This will only include results that belong
  to a DEFINED location. [:refine_search_location_apology(other=undefined)]
  [:refine_search_location_help]

refine_search_location_undefined_help: >
  Enter name of a location.  This will only include results that DO NOT belong
  to a defined location. [:refine_search_location_apology(other=defined)]
  [:refine_search_location_help]

refine_search_locations_help: >
  Includes both defined or undefined locations.
  [:refine_search_multiple_help(things="location_names")]
  [:refine_search_location_help]

refine_search_location_help: >
  Use "*" as a wildcard.  Punctuation and case is ignored, but abbreviations
  must be correct if included.  For example "Marin County, CA" will NOT match
  "Marin Co., California".  However, "marin co california" and
  "Marin*California" will.

refine_search_location_apology: >
  Sorry, you must use a different flavor of query to search for results that
  belong to [other] locations.  A good starting point is
  '[:app_list_locations]' in the left-hand panel.

refine_search_misspellings_help: >
  Use this parameter to tell it how to deal with misspellings.  All name
  queries accept this parameter.  By default it screens out misspellings
  ("[:refine_search_misspellings_no]"), however you can ask it to return both
  ("[:refine_search_misspellings_either]") or only misspelt ones
  ("[:refine_search_misspellings_only]").

refine_search_model_flavor_help: >
  These are all of our basic query flavors.  The names might be a bit obscure.
  It might be easier to go browsing around normally until you find a query
  that is close to what you want and refine that query instead.  Another
  option is to select one of the unconstrained queries like "all observations"
  or "all images" as good starting points.

refine_search_modified_help: >
  [:refine_search_time_help]

refine_search_multiple_help: >
  List one or more [things].  Either enter them one at a time on separate
  lines, updating the form after each one, or enter several at once on the same
  line, separated by the special word "OR".

refine_search_name_help: >
  Enter the name the query is based on.  If this is an "observations of
  children of a given name" query, this is the "given name" whose children it
  uses.  This can be any rank, but must resolve to a single name.  In the case
  of ambiguity, it takes the first one it finds.  Update the form to see which
  name it chooses.

refine_search_names_help: >
  [:refine_search_multiple_help(things="names")] You can enter any rank, not
  just species, e.g.  "A*muscaria*flavivolvata" or "Agaricales".  Note,
  however, that listing higher taxa returns those taxa only, not the children
  of it.  Thus Agaricus returns only Agarcius, not the species of Agaricus.

refine_search_nonconsensus_help: >
  Use this parameter to tell it how to deal with alternate proposed names for
  observations.  By default it only considers the consensus name
  ("[:refine_search_nonconsensus_no]"), however you can tell it to include all
  proposed names ("[:refine_search_nonconsensus_all]") or JUST the alternates
  ("[:refine_search_nonconsensus_exclusive]").

  [:refine_search_multiple_help(things="titles")] Use "*" for a wildcard.  You
  may also enter partial titles.

refine_search_synonym_names_help: >
  [:refine_search_multiple_help(things="names")]

refine_search_synonyms_help: >
  Use this parameter to tell it how to deal with synonyms of the name given
  above.  By default it includes observations of synonyms
  ("[:refine_search_synonyms_all]"), however you can tell it to ignore synonyms
  ("[:refine_search_synonyms_no]") or include JUST synonyms
  ("[:refine_search_synonyms_exclusive]").  Note that for this purpose,
  misspelt names are treated exactly the same as the correctly-spelled name.

# INTRO PAGE

# observer/intro
intro_title: Introduction
intro_purpose: >
  *Purpose:* The purpose of this site is to record observations about
  mushrooms, help people identify mushrooms they aren't familiar with, and
  expand the community around the scientific exploration of mushrooms
  (mycology).  Some have asked what counts as a mushroom.  This site takes a
  very broad view.  While the emphasis is on the large fleshy fungi, other
  fungi such as lichens, rust and molds as well as fungus-like organisms such
  as slime-molds are all welcome.  Ultimately, I hope this site will become a
  valuable resource for both amateur and professional mycologists.  I like to
  think of it as a living field guide for mushrooms or a collaborative mushroom
  field journal.
  \n\n
  For those new to mycology, there is a huge amount of basic research that
  still needs to be done.  By some estimates less that 5% of the world's
  species of fungi are known to science.  While things are slightly better for
  the large fleshy fungi known as mushrooms, it is still a common experience to
  come across a mushroom that cannot be easily identified in the available
  books or which doesn't really fit the definition of any recognized species.
  This site is intended to address that gap by creating a place for us to talk
  about and record what we've found, as well as connect to the existing
  literature about mushrooms.  Please do not feel intimidated by the scientific
  bent of the site.  Everyone is welcome to dive in and add their own mushroom
  observations, upload mushroom photos and make [:comments] on other people's
  observations.

intro_image_sharing: >
  *Image Sharing:* This site follows the principles of cooperative sharing
  pioneered by the "Free Software Foundation":http://fsf.org, further expressed
  by the "Open Source software movement":http://opensource.org, and expanded to
  other creative efforts by the "Creative Commons":http://creativecommons.org.
  Consequently all images are made available under one of the Creative Commons
  licenses.  In short this means that when anyone uploads one of their images
  to the site, they are giving others explicit permission to use those images
  under certain "conditions":/observer/how_to_use#license in perpetuity.  This
  type of permission is very important for basic research.  It allows future
  researchers to freely use these data to expand our understanding of
  mushrooms.  It also significantly increases the likelihood that the data will
  continue to be available into the distant future.
  \n\n
  If you upload your own images, this license does not mean you are giving up
  your copyright or your ability to make money off your images.  Depending on
  which license you choose, you can still require that anyone who wishes to use
  any of these images for commercial purposes, get in touch with the copyright
  holder and work out the conditions for that use.  The site includes special
  links on the image pages to help create those relationships.

intro_source_code: >
  *Source Code:* Source code for the site is available at: "[repo]":[repo] and
  is licensed under the "Open Source MIT
  License":http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php.  Source code

  p(normal).  So far [:app_title] has been an entirely volunteer effort,
  we have begun to make it financially sustainable as the founding resource
  for the non-profit "Consortium for Digital Mycology Resources":http://digitalmycology.org,
  but the effort is just getting so let us know if you want to get involved or
  have any business related advice.

# HOW TO USE PAGE (COMMON TASKS)

# observer/how_to_use
how_title: How to Use [:app_title]
how_common_tasks: Common Tasks
how_glossary: Concepts Glossary

how_intro: >
  This page provides some short descriptions of common uses of this website
  followed by an overview of the basic concepts used.

how_keeping_up: >
  *Keeping Up with Changes* - The default page for [:app_title] is the
  '[:rss_log_title]', it is also accessible through the '"Latest Changes":/'
  link in the left-hand panel.  This page shows you the most recent changes on
  the site.  It lists new "Observations":#observation and "Species
  Lists":#species_list as well as significant changes to any already existing
  ones.  Additions of "Images":#image and "Comments":#comment are considered
  significant changes to the relevant observations.  Changes to "Names":#name
  are also listed.  Click the page numbers at the top and bottom of the page
  to browse through older changes.  Observations and names created as a side
  effect of other changes are not listed separately.
  \n\n
  Note: The latest changes can be tracked using our "RSS feed":/observer/rss.
  See this "wikipedia article":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss for more
  information about RSS feeds.

how_searching: >
  *Searching* - There are several interesting ways to search for information on
  the site.  The simplest is to type a search string into the search box near
  the top of each page and click one of the buttons next to it.  This will give
  you a list of all the "Observations":#observation, "Images":#image,
  "Names":#name or "Locations":#location that contain fields matching the given
  string.  If you need a little more control over the search, try clicking
  '[:app_advanced_search]'.
  \n\n
  You may also browse the site using the links in the left-hand panel.  For
  example, '[:app_index_a_z]' shows all the species that have observations,
  listed alphabetically.  You can page through this list, or skip directly to
  the letter of a name you are interested in by clicking the appropriate page
  number or letter along the top or bottom of the list.  Click a name from this
  list to see a description of the species and a list of observations of that
  species.  If you click a genus like 'Agaricus', it will also show a list of
  species in that genus.  Note, however, that in this case it will only show
  observations that have been identified to the genus level, not ones that have
  been identified as a species in that genus.  On the other hand, if two names
  are considered synonyms, you will see observations for either name on this
  page.  (*NOTE*: If you do a search on 'Agaricus', it _will_ show all the
  observations whose name contains that string, so you get all the observations
  that belong to that genus.)
  \n\n
  Whenever you click an observation or other result on an index page, it will
  take you to a page showing that result.  At the top of the page you will see
  '[:PREV]', '[:NEXT]', and '[:INDEX]' links.  These let you browse
  forward or backward through the results or return to the index.  At the top
  of the index page you will often see links allowing you to sort the results
  by different criteria, such as by date, name or user.  In the same place you
  will sometimes find links that let you turn an index of observations into an
  index of names or images of those same observations.  For example, if you
  click '[:app_your_observations]', it will show you a list of observations you
  have posted.  Click '[:show_objects(types=:names)]' at the top of the
  page to see a list of the species you have seen, or click
  '[:show_objects(types=:locations)]' to see a list of all the locations
  you've gone mushrooming in.
  \n\n
  Power users may also be interested in our new API providing direct access to
  our database back-end.  This can be used to mine our database for images or
  species descriptions for inclusion in wikipedia or other public websites.
  You can also use it to upload observations and images and much more.  Please
  contact the webmaster for more information.

how_unknown_help: >
  *Getting Help with an Unknown* - In order to get help with an unknown, you
  need to have a user account.  These can be created easily by selecting
  '[:app_create_account]' from the left-hand panel.  See the discussion of
  "Users":#user below for more details.
  \n\n
  Once you are logged in, create a new "Observation":#observation by selecting
  '[:app_create_observation]' in the left-hand panel.  Enter all the details
  you can into the resulting form.  You can leave the '[:WHAT]' field blank
  call it '[:unknown]', or if you think you know the genus or family or
  other group, give that "Name":#name followed by 'sp.', e.g., 'Russula sp.'.
  In the '[:NOTES]' field provide information about habitat, odor, smell
  and anything else not clear from the photos.  Once the form is as complete as
  you can make it, click '[:CREATE]'.
  \n\n
  You should now be looking at a page showing you the information you just
  entered.  However, if you used a name that is not currently in the database,
  you will be asked if you want to add the name.  This also gives you a chance
  to catch and fix typos.  In addition, if you use a name that is considered
  deprecated, you will be given the option of using a preferred synonym.
  \n\n
  Once you have created the new observation, you can upload any "Images":#image
  you have by selecting the '[:show_observation_add_images]' link on the
  right-side of the page.  It is very important either that it be an image you
  took or that you have the explicit permission of the person who created the
  image to upload it to the site.  If you did not take the image, please update
  the '[:form_images_copyright_holder]' field to reflect the actual owner.  This
  page also allows you to select the "License":#license you want to release the
  image under.
  \n\n
  When you add unknowns, the community will generally "propose one or more
  names":#proposing_names for it within 24-hours.  If you find any of the
  suggested names compelling, you should not hesitate to revisit your
  observation and "Vote":#vote on them.  Please see the discussion below on
  "voting":#voting, as well.  Members of the community may also post feedback
  via "Comments":#comment.  By default your account is set up to deliver
  comments posted about your observations to you by email.  If you are asked to
  provide more details on the collection, we prefer that you select
  '[:show_observation_edit_observation]' (at the top of the observation page)
  and add them to the '[:NOTES]' field than to just post another comment.

how_adding_observations: >
  *Adding Observations You Have Identified* - Use the same process as "Getting
  Help with an Unknown":#unknown_help, except this time provide your
  identification in the '[:WHAT]' field.  You are strongly encouraged to
  say something about how you arrived at the identification.  We've provided a
  small set of checkboxes to make this easy ('[:naming_reason_label_1]',
  '[:naming_reason_label_3]', etc.), but you are encouraged to elaborate on
  them in the provided text fields (e.g., list the references you used, or
  enter 'sequenced the DNA and compared it against the data in GenBank'!).
  Community members will often post "Comments":#comment if there is some
  question about the collection or if they would like clarification as to why
  you ruled out other "Names":#name.

how_proposing_names: >
  *Proposing Names* - Any member of the community can propose "Names":#name for
  any "Observations":#observation.  Click an observation (e.g., from the
  '[:rss_log_title]' page) and scroll down below the observation notes.  There
  should be a list of "Proposed Names":#proposed_name enclosed in a thin
  outlined box.  Most observations will already have at least one proposed name
  (by the owner).  From here you may either click
  '[:show_namings_propose_new_name]' or "Vote":#voting on existing names.  In
  either case you will have to log in before you are allowed to do so.
  \n\n
  When you click '[:show_namings_propose_new_name]' you will be presented with
  a form much like the one used to create an observation.  In addition to the
  name, you are required to choose a confidence level.  This is your
  "Vote":#vote, and you may change it on the
  '[:show_object(type=:observation)]' page at any time you like.  As with
  creating an observation, you are strongly encouraged to give some explanation
  as to why you think your Name applies to this Observation (and why other
  names don't).  When you are finished, click '[:CREATE]'.  You will be
  given a chance to correct typos or to choose an accepted name if you entered
  a deprecated one.
  \n\n
  Users are not allowed to propose a name if someone else has already done so.
  The only reason to do so would be to describe alternative reasons for
  reaching the same conclusion.  Instead use the discussion forum provided by
  comments to do this.

how_voting: >
  *Voting on Proposed Names* - Click an "Observation":#observation, e.g., from
  the '[:rss_log_title]' page, and scroll down to the
  '[:show_namings_proposed_names]' box.  Note that you must login before you
  can see or change any of your "Votes":#vote.  Once you have logged in, you
  should see pulldown menus next to each "Proposed Name":#proposed_name.  Your
  vote expresses the degree of confidence or agreement you have with placing
  that name on that observation.  Everything above '[min_neg_vote]' is
  considered a positive vote, everything below '[min_pos_vote]' negative.
  Choose '[no_opinion]' to tell it to delete your vote.  When you've changed
  all the votes you want to, be sure to click '[:show_namings_update_votes]' to
  record your votes.  Don't worry, if you forget and try to navigate away
  without casting your votes it will complain (unless you have Javascript
  disabled).
  \n\n
  Roughly speaking, votes for a name are weighted, summed and then divided by
  the number of votes for that name.  The name with the highest score wins, and
  that name will be applied to that observation throughout the site.  In the
  case where multiple synonyms are proposed for an observation it lumps the
  votes together, choosing each user's strongest vote within that group of
  synonyms.  In the end, assuming that group of synonyms wins, the currently
  accepted name is used as the community consensus.  If there is still debate
  in the scientific community about which name is appropriate for a given
  taxon, then it will use votes the best it can to decide between multiple
  accepted names.  Note that the owner's vote automatically carries a little
  more weight, as do the votes of users who have made a large
  "Contribution":#contribution to [:app_title] or who are considered
  experts.  Click '[:app_contributors]' or click a user's name to see the
  contribution and expert status.  (We use the log base 10 of users'
  contributions.)

how_adding_comments: >
  *Adding Comments* - When you are looking at an "Observation":#observation, if
  you would like to post or respond to a "Comment":#comment, select the
  '[:show_comments_add_comment]' link near the top of the page.  If you are
  not currently logged in to a "User":#user account, you will be asked to log
  in.  Once you are logged in, you will be given a form asking for a summary
  and your comment.  Note that you can do some simple formatting in the comment
  section.  This is briefly documented below the text field with a link to
  detailed documentation.  You can also add links within a comment using
  standard HTML formatting.  The HTML gets automatically cleaned to avoid
  security problems like script injection, so try not to get too fancy.

how_tracking_species: >
  *Tracking a Particular Species or Genus Through Email* - [:app_title]
  allows you to request an email any time a particular "Name":#name is given to
  an "Observation":#observation.  If that name is a genus or species it will
  also send you an email whenever a species or subspecies is observed.  To turn
  this feature on, go to the page for a Name you are interested in (see
  "Searching":#searching) and click '[:show_name_email_tracking]'.  You can
  configure it so that the person who made the observation that was given that
  name will be sent a customized email to let them know you are interested in
  their observation.  If you don't provide any instructions, they will not be
  sent an email.  If the observer gives the name at the time the observation is
  created, they will be shown your message immediately through the website.
  You can modify or disable your request for a particular name by going back to
  that name and again selecting '[:show_name_email_tracking]' and clicking the
  '[:DISABLE]' button on the page that comes up.

how_describing_species: >
  *Describing Species* - Click any "Name":#name link you see throughout the
  site.  For example, click any of the results listed in
  '"[:app_index_a_z]":/name/observation_index', search for a name in the search
  bar, or click the 'About &lt;name&gt;...' link at the top of any
  "Observation":#observation page.  These all take you to a page summarizing
  everything we know about this taxon.  If you are familiar with this species
  and there is something you would like to add, click
  '[:show_name_edit_name]' and add your notes.  You are encouraged to cite
  references including field guides and scientific papers.  Short quotes from
  references are fine, but please don't make extensive quotes without obtaining
  permission from the original author.

how_projects: >
  *Projects* - Projects are a way for a group of "Users":#user to work together
  to create a set of work that they want to keep out of the public eye until
  they are ready to publish it.  The original purpose was to support university
  classes where there was a desire to keep a more controlled environment while
  the class was going.
  \n\n
  Anyone can create a new project by clicking on
  '"[:app_list_projects]":/project/list_projects' in the left-hand panel and
  then clicking on '[:list_projects_add_project]'.  The person who creates the
  project is always a member and an administrator for that project.  An
  administrator for a project can add new members by clicking the
  '[:show_project_add_members]' link at the top of a project's 'Show Project'
  page.  Administrators can also make other users administrators for the
  project by going to one of the '[:add_members_change_status]' links available
  on the 'Show Project' or 'Add Members' pages.  Any User can send requests to
  the admins for a project.  These requests are emailed to the admins and
  contain a link for changing that user's status.
  \n\n
  Currently the primary focus of projects is writing
  "Descriptions":#description for various species.  Note, however, that anyone
  can now create new descriptions for a species (see "Describing
  Species":#describing_species) by clicking on
  '[:show_name_create_description]' at the top of the 'Show Name' page.
  Descriptions that are created for a project are visible only to members of
  that project until they are published, and editable only by the owner of the
  description and project administrators.  When a description is published it
  will become the official description if no official description exists yet.

how_maps: >
  *Working with Maps* - Currently there are three types of maps available on
  [:app_title]: Occurrence Maps (e.g., "Occurrence map for
  **__Craterellus cornucopioides__**":/name/map/284), Location Maps (e.g.,
  "Salt Point State Park":/location/show_location/4) and the
  "[:map_locations_global_map]":/location/map_locations.
  \n\n
  To see an occurrence map for a particular "Name":#name, go to the page for
  that name (e.g., enter the name in the search bar, select '[:NAMES]'), and
  click '[:app_search]', then click '[:show_name_distribution_map]' at the
  top of the page.
  \n\n
  "Users":#user are encouraged to add to the occurrence map for a name.  The
  easiest way is to create a new "Observation":#observation using an already
  defined "Location":#location.  Note, however, that auto-completion for the
  '[:WHERE]' field will list all matching locations whether they are
  defined or not.
  \n\n
  You can also explicitly choose not to have an observation show up on the
  occurrence map.  This allows you to record observations of mushrooms in
  places like mushroom fairs, old photos or other places where you may not know
  where the mushroom was actually collected.  When creating or editing an
  observation there is a checkbox labeled
  '[:form_observations_is_collection_location]'.  By default it is checked.  If
  you uncheck it, that observation will not appear in any occurrence maps.

how_defining_locations: >
  *Defining Undefined Locations* - Many "Observations":#observation have been
  reported from undefined "Locations":#location.  These observations will not
  appear in our "occurrence maps":#maps.  An excellent, easy way for
  "Users":#user to help out if they have a little spare time is to locate and
  defined these undefined locations.
  \n\n
  When browsing through observations, defined location names will be followed
  by a link labeled '[:click_for_map]'.  Undefined location names will be
  followed by a link labeled '[:SEARCH]'.  If you click the link for an
  undefined location, it will show a list of observations reported for that
  location.  The resulting page will include two links at the top of the page:
  '[:list_observations_location_define]' and '[:list_observations_location_merge]'.  Clicking on
  '[:list_observations_location_define]' will present a form which you can use to create that
  location.  Clicking on 'Merge With a Defined Location' will present you with
  a list of similar locations which have already been defined.  Clicking on any
  of these locations will perform the merge.
  \n\n
  You can also see a list of all locations in use by clicking on
  '"[:app_list_locations]":/location/list_locations' in the left-hand panel.
  This page lists both the defined locations (first column, sorted
  alphabetically) and the undefined locations (second column, sorted by the
  number of observations reported from that location).  In some cases the same
  location has been given multiple names (e.g., 'Point Reyes National Seashore'
  and 'Pt Reyes Park').  You can merge an undefined location with a defined
  location by clicking on '[:list_place_names_merge]' next to the undefined
  location (see above).
  \n\n
  When defining a new location, the first thing to do is to review its name.
  Mushroom Observer tries to enforce a set of "rules":/location/help.
  \n\n
  In theory it is possible for the same location to be defined more than once
  (presumably by different users).  If this happens, you can request a merge by
  editing one of the two locations and changing its name to be exactly the same
  as the other's.  This will not have any immediate effect, but it will display
  a warning message, and an email will be sent to the site administrators with
  the details.  Merging defined locations is restricted since it can cause
  significant data loss.

how_creating_species_lists: >
  *Creating Species Lists* - To create a "Species List":#species_list, click
  '"[:app_create_list]":/species_list/create_species_list' in the left-hand
  panel.  Fill out the various fields.  In the 'Write-In Species' field, you
  should give each species a "Name":#name on a line by itself.  When you go to
  create the list, each line is checked to see if there is a match in the
  database.  If there is no matching name, you will be asked if you want to add
  the unknown names to the database.  This gives you a chance to catch and fix
  typos as well as giving you a simple way to add missing names.  Each name
  given in the 'Write-In Species' field (or loaded from a file) will be used to
  create a completely new "Observation":#observation.  The
  '[:form_species_lists_list_notes]' are only shown when the entire species
  list is shown.  Use '[:form_species_lists_member_notes]' to indicate text you
  would like to add to each new observation.
  \n\n
  There are several methods of collecting a set of existing observations into a
  new list.  In the simplest method, first create an empty species list, then
  go to each of the observations you want to add and select
  '[:show_observation_manage_species_lists]'.  This will give you the
  opportunity to add that observation to any species list you own.  (Note, you
  can add anyone's observations to a species list you own.)
  \n\n
  In another method, you may select '[:app_create_list]' directly from any
  index of observations or names.  For example, you may use the search bar at
  the top of the page or the
  '"[:app_advanced_search]":/observer/advanced_search_form' feature to request
  all observations from Michigan.  When it shows you the first page of results,
  click '[:app_create_list]' (in the left-hand panel), and it will give you
  a list of all the matching names to choose from in the new species list form.
  \n\n
  Lastly, when you are viewing an existing species list, you may click
  '[:species_list_show_clone_list]' or '[:species_list_show_set_source]' at the
  top of the page.  '[:species_list_show_clone_list]' will take you directly to
  a new species list form, with all the information of the existing list
  already filled in.  '[:species_list_show_set_source]' will copy that species
  list's names to the clipboard.  The next time you click
  '[:app_create_list]', the new species list form will give you this list of
  names to choose from (unless you show another observation or name index in
  the meantime).

how_comment: >
  *Comment* - Comments are the standard way to discuss an
  "Observation":#observation or its associated "Images":#image.  Each comment
  is owned by a particular "User":#user.  A comment may only be edited or
  deleted by the owner or a site administrator.  You can look up all comments
  that have been made about your observations by clicking on
  '"[:show_user_comments_for_you]":/comment/show_comments_for_user' in the
  left-hand panel.

how_contribution: >
  *Contribution* - A number or score that measures the quantity and quality of
  contributions a "User":#user has made to [:app_title].  Click
  '[:app_your_summary]' to see a break-down of your own contribution.  You
  earn points for every "Observation":#observation, "Image":#image,
  "Comment":#comment, etc. you have posted.  "Describing
  Species":#describing_species and "Defining Locations":defining_locations are
  some of the most important contributions a user can make.  (See "How To
  Help":/observer/how_to_help for a list of other ways to help out.)
  Currently, contribution is used only in weighting your "Votes":#vote when
  voting on "Proposed Names":#proposed_names for observations.

how_description: >
  *Species Description* - A collection of text describing a "Name":#name.
  Every name automatically gets one official description that everyone in the
  community is allowed to read and modify.  Additional descriptions may be
  created by any "User":#user, including project members.  The owner of a
  description may choose any level of read or write permissions, and can
  control who is given authorship credit.  Since descriptions, especially the
  official one, are often collaborative efforts, modifications by a user are
  subject to community review, and past versions are kept to facilitate this
  process.  The content of a description includes a set list of sections,
  including things like '[:form_names_gen_desc]', '[:form_names_diag_desc]',
  '[:form_names_look_alikes]', '[:form_names_refs]' and other notes.

how_image: >
  *Image* - A photograph or illustration of one or more mushroom species.
  Images are associated with one or more "Observations":#observation.  A given
  Image is owned by a particular "User":#user who may or may not be the
  copyright holder.  Only the owner or a site administrator can remove an image
  or edit the associated information.  All images in the site are required to
  be released under one of the "Creative Commons
  licenses":http://creativecommons.org.  If you dispute the given copyright or
  the licensing of an image you are the copyright holder of, send mail to the
  "webmaster":/observer/ask_webmaster_question.

how_license: >
  *License* - "Images":#image on [:app_title] are posted with an explicit
  license.  The current options are the "Creative Commons Attribution, Share
  Alike License":http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ and the
  "Creative Commons Attribution, Non-Commercial, Share Alike
  License":http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/.  The primary
  difference is whether the image can be used in any potentially commercial
  setting.  One of the side effects of selecting the non-commercial license is
  that your image cannot be used on "Wikipedia":http://wikipedia.org.  The
  license can be set on a per image basis.  The looser, Wikipedia compatible
  license is the default for new "Users":#user.  However, you can select the
  non-commercial license to be your default by selecting it on your
  '"[:app_preferences]":/account/prefs' page and clicking on
  '[:SAVE_CHANGES]'.

how_location: >
  *Location* - A rectangular region enclosing a given location, as defined by
  the northern, southern, eastern and western boundaries.  In addition to the
  position, locations can also include a minimum and maximum elevation along
  with various notes.  Note that the elevations should be in meters not feet.
  A location is not considered to be owned by a particular "User":#user.  Any
  user may change or define any location, but all of a user's changes are
  subject to review by the community.  To help with this review process, copies
  of the previous versions are kept.

how_name: >
  *Name* - A name for some group of mushrooms.  Most commonly this is the name
  of a species, but it can be any taxon (genus, family, variety, etc.).  Names
  can also refer to groups that are not officially recognized scientific names
  such as common names or functional groups like Gasteromyces.  A name is *not*
  considered to be owned by a particular "User":#user.  Any user may change any
  name, but all changes are subject to review by the community.  To help with
  this review process, copies of previous versions are kept.  Names can have an
  acknowledged author.  The author is normally only given for scientific names.
  The author should follow the standard practice of listing the person who
  first correctly published the name.  In the case of names at or below the
  species level, the author may also include the person who transfered the
  species to the current genus, e.g., (Singer) Jenkins.

how_observation: >
  *Observation* - A record of a single mushroom species at a particular time
  and "Location":#location.  Typically associated with one or more
  "Names":#name (see "Proposed Name":#proposed_name below) and some number of
  "Images":#image.  Each observation is owned by a "User":#user, and can only
  be edited or deleted by that user or a site administrator.  However, any user
  may post "Comments":#comment about any observation.  Observations can also be
  included in one or more "Species Lists:#species_list.

how_proposed_name: >
  *Proposed Name* - A "Name":#name as proposed for a given
  "Observation":#observation.  Any number of names may be proposed for a single
  observation by members of the community.  No special treatment is given to
  any member's name.  Community consensus is arrived at through the process of
  "voting":#voting.  Each proposed name for an observation is owned by a single
  "User":#user.  However, even the user who proposed the name cannot
  necessarily modify or delete a name once other members of the community have
  cast "Votes":#vote for or against it.  Fortunately you may always propose
  additional names.  There is never any sort of penalty associated with
  proposing incorrect names.

how_species_list: >
  *Species List* - A list of "Observations":#observation (not "Names":#name).
  Includes a date, a "Location":#location and a title for the list.  A given
  species list is owned by a particular "User":#user.  Only the owner or a site
  administrator can change or delete a species list.  There are no strict rules
  for how species lists should be used.  This is an area that is likely to
  change in the future as the community comes up with clearer ideas for how
  they should be used.

how_user: >

letter_title: Open Letter to the Community
letter_body: >
  To the Mushroom Observer Community,
  <br/><br/>
  It has been an amazing year for us.  This year we hit some
  major milestones: 100,000 images, 50,000 observations and
  2,000 registered users.  This means we have essentially
  been doubling every year.  While Jason has achieved some
  minor miracles in his volunteer efforts to keep things
  going with the bare bones server configuration we are
  using, it is becoming clear that we will soon need more
  memory and more processors to support our continued growth.
  <br/><br/>
  Unfortunately, this means our server expenses will be going
  up.  So far I have been happy to support the Mushroom
  Observer server needs out of my own pocket, but those
  expenses have also been essentially doubling every year and
  I will soon not be able to afford it.  As a result, I would like to
  start asking for donations from the community.  Those of you who have
  gotten a lot out of the site and want to see it continue to grow and
  expand, now is your chance to give a little back and help with the
  financial support of the site.
  <br/><br/>
  To that end, we have setup
  a "donation page":/support/donate that can
  securely accept money from a PayPal account or a regular credit card.
  <br/><br/>
  I would like to raise at least $2000 to cover basic server costs.
  The more we get, the more we can expand our capacity for
  traffic and growth.  And the fewer times you will encounter server
  down time and failed uploads.
  <br/><br/>
  When you make a donation, your name by default will be added to our
  "donors page":/support/donors as soon as we confirm the donation.
  If you would prefer to donote anonymously or make other special arrangements
  for your acknowledgement, "send a comment":/observer/ask_webmaster_question
  after you make your donation.
  <br/><br/>
  Please help support this active internet community of
  people who enjoy sharing and learning more about the
  mushrooms around us.
  <br/><br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
  -Nathan

# LANGUAGE HELP PAGE

location_help_title: Locations in Mushroom Observer

location_help_intro: >
  The Mushroom Observer provides two ways to represent the geographic location 
  of an observation.  The simplest are latitude and longitude positions associated 
  with the observation.  Please keep these accurate to within at least 300 meters 
  (or about 1000 feet).  However, the more widely used method is a simple phrase 
  describing the location.  For example, "Beebe Woods, Falmouth, Massachusetts, USA".
  The goal of these location names is to provide a consistent, reusable way of talking
  about where an observation was made without necessarily revealing a precise "spot".
  If you are comfortable provide more precise lat/longs for an observation, the
  location names are still useful for searches so you are encouraged to provide
  them as well.  The location names should, by default, go from the smallest
  contained area to the country name.  If you prefer to describe your locations
  as going from the largest (country) down to the smallest contained area, you can
  change your preference from the default, "Postal", to "Scientific" on your 
  preference page.  There are cases such as
  "Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Blount Co., Tennessee, USA",
  where the area you are describing overlaps a number of counties, states or
  even countries.  In these cases, the country and other official political
  boundaries should come at the end as shown in the example.
  \n\n
  Originally, the Mushroom Observer was very loose about these location names, 
  hoping that the users would create a reasonably consistent set of rules and 
  correct each other.  After about four years and thousands of location names, 
  we found that there were rules emerging, but they were not applied at all 
  consistently and people were not tending to directly correct each other.  
  Consequently, we have tried to codify these rules and when reasonable to provide 
  warnings if you attempt to create a new location that violates these rules.  
  It is not always possible to correct identify "bad" locations, so if you get 
  some warnings, but after reviewing the location decide it should be "good", 
  then simply resubmitting the form will force the name into the database.  
  However, all new location names will get reviewed regularly and may get changed 
  to better fit the consensus rules.  Below are some examples of "bad" and "good" 
  location names followed by a more detailed explanation of the current rules.  
  Each example is labeled with the following section that explains the example 
  in more detail.  These rules are by no means set it stone and we encourage the 
  discussion and revision of them.

location_help_example_help: These are cases that are not detected automatically, so no warning would be given.
location_help_example_title: Some examples
location_help_bad: Bad
location_help_good: Good
location_help_explanation: Explanation
location_help_rules_title: The Current "Rules"

location_help_rule_reversible: >
  *Consistent and Reversible Order* - You can now ask for location names to appear in the reverse order from the default.  
  Thus, you can see a location as either:
  \n\n
  Albion, California, USA
  \n\n
  or as
  \n\n
  USA, California, Albion
  \n\n
  You can change this on your Preferences page by selecting 'Postal' (the default) 
  or 'Scientific' (the one that starts with the country).  When you input new location 
  names it will of course also follow your preferred order.
  \n\n
  Roy Halling was the inspiration for this feature when he started putting in his 
  locations starting with the country names and we got into a discussion about it.  
  Apparently the standard practice in the scientific community is to start with the 
  largest locale (typically a country) and work down to the smallest locale (a county, 
  town or specific location).  From looking through all the locations that have been 
  put into MO, it is clear that most people expect to put in the smallest location 
  first and work up to the country.
  \n\n
  In order to enable this feature, I have had to require that the place names be 
  easily and consistently reversible.  This means you must separate each section 
  of the location with a ', ' (no period, no missing spaces, no double spaces).  
  It also means that you should always enter the names in order of increasing size 
  when you can.  There are some specific exceptions to this rule that are discussed 
  below.

location_help_rule_countries: >
  *Use Country Names* - As a further check when you enter an unfamiliar location, it will check to see that 
  the largest locale has been previously entered for some other location.  This list 
  currently consists of only countries, continents and the special location 'Unknown'.  
  Since it does not include all possible countries, it is still possible to override 
  the check by resubmitting the same name twice.  Such entries will be reviewed carefully 
  to ensure that this list remains clean.  For now you should only enter country names 
  as they are written in English.  For example, please use 'Germany' rather than 
  'Deutschland'.  The goal for the moment is simply consistency.  However, the long 
  term goal is to actually allow these names to be consistently translated based on 
  the user's language selection.  Continents should only be used if the country is 
  not known or there is no country.

location_help_rule_states: >
  *Use State Names* - In the case of countries where I know the states, I also check for those as 
  the next smallest area within a country.  At the moment I am checking this 
  for Canada, Australia and USA.  The primary goal of this in the US at least 
  is to ensure the uniqueness of the next element in the list.  In the US it 
  is not unusual to have the same city or county name in more than one state.  
  If there are other countries where this check would be useful, please let me 
  know and include an exhaustive list of all states, provinces, territories etc.  
  To increase the understandability to people from other parts of the world, 
  state abbreviations (even extremely standard ones) are discouraged and will 
  create a warning.  The one current exception is 'Washington DC'.  Many people 
  are not aware of what the 'DC' stands for and would be unlikely to enter 
  'Washington, District of Columbia'.  Note that in this case I have also 
  removed the ', ' since that would cause 'USA, DC, Washington' when in 
  'Scientific' mode.

location_help_rule_counties: >
  *Counties OR Cities* - In the past, MO has encouraged the use of county names whenever they are 
  known.  The new policy is that the county should only be included when it 
  is the smallest political area the location is contained in or when the 
  city or town name is ambiguous.  For example, what used to be described as 
  "Berkeley, Alameda Co., California, USA" should now be given as just 
  "Berkeley, California, USA".  This change is in part due to seeing what 
  people actually do.  Generally people have been good about using county 
  names in the case of public lands like parks and national forests where 
  the county is the most obvious political boundary.  However, with cities 
  and towns people often don't know what county a city or town is in.  In 
  addition, the information is typically redundant for towns and cities in 
  the US where they are almost always completely contained in county or they 
  are independent of the counties and there are almost never two towns with 
  same names in a state (there are exceptions though such as Goshen, Vermont).  
  I've also found that many of the map services such as maps.google.com and 
  maps.yahoo.com get confused if you include both the city and the county in 
  the search string.
  \n\n
  That being said, there are also often areas that have a local name, but are 
  not actually an incorporated city or town.  In these cases the county name 
  is encouraged since the names cannot be assumed to be unique.  For example, 
  "North Lakeport, Lake Co., California, USA".  Wikipedia has been the most 
  helpful resource I've found for determining if a town is actually 
  incorporated.

location_help_rule_near: >
  *Use 'near'* - If there is a landmark or town near to the collection location, but the 
  smallest political boundary is a county or country, then it is helpful to 
  mention this using the word "near".  When used this way it should always be
  all lowercase.  For example, 
  "Albis Mountain Range, near Zurich, Switzerland".  Looking through the old 
  data, I found users used both "near" and "area" for this with "near" being 
  more common.  This is also better because "area" sometimes gets used for 
  place names such as "Day-Use Area" or "Rest Area".

location_help_rule_southern: >
  *Use of 'Southern', 'Northern' etc.* - If there isn't a known a clear landmark or town near the collection 
  location, it is fine to use compass directions such as 'Southern', 
  'Northern', 'Southwestern' etc.  In these cases always use the '-ern' 
  ending to indicate that it's descriptive.  However, these terms should be 
  avoided if it creates ambiguity.  For example, "Western Australia" is the 
  name of an official state in Australia, so it should only be used as such 
  and should be followed by the country name.

location_help_rule_abbr: >
  *Avoid Abbreviations (and Periods in General)* - Most abbreviations should be
  avoided since people apply them somewhat 
  arbitrarily and inconsistently.  The following are examples of abbreviations 
  that should definitely be avoided: Hwy, Mt, Mtn, CA, BC.  However, there are 
  some specific examples, that should be used in preference to there spelled 
  out versions.  These are:
  \n\n
  Co. for County\n
  Rd. for Road\n
  St. for Street\n
  Ave. for Avenue\n
  Blvd. for Boulevard\n
  USA for United States of America\n
  Washington DC for Washington, District of Columbia\n
  \n\n
  Periods in general should be avoided except for the above abbreviations.  
  They should not be used at the end of country names or as separators.\n
  Finally, 'and' should be used rather than '&'.

location_help_rule_other: >
  *Other Things to Avoid* - All lowercase - In general at least the leading letter of each area should 
  be capitalized and when in doubt capitalize every leading letter.\n
  No lat/longs - There is now direct support for this for each observation.  
  Do not include it in the name of a location.\n
  No habitat info - Habitat info should go in the notes for the observation.\n
  Parentheses and Braces - If you're tempted to use parentheses or braces, stop yourself
  and ask if this information should be in the notes for the observation or if there is a 
  better way to describe the location.\n
  Avoid diacritics (eg é, ü etc.) - As mentioned when discussing country names, you should 
  try to use the English version of a location name when possible and English does 
  not include diacritics.  This is intended to encourage consistency and we are 
  planning on providing proper support for other languages which will benefit from 
  this consistency.  There are certainly cases where the a city or region is only 
  know by a name that includes diacritics.  In these cases they should be used.  
  A few simple web-searches should give you a good idea if there is a common English 
  variation of a name (e.g., Montreal, Quebec for Montréal, Québec).

location_help_rule_good_habits: >
  *Stuff You Are Encouraged to Do* - If you are creating a new name, take some time to figure out a good name.  
  Searching within Mushroom Observer can be helpful.  If you don't find anything 
  there, then look things up in Google Maps (http://maps.google.com) and Wikipedia (http://wikipedia.org).  
  Also feel free to use the notes section of either an observation or a location 
  to be more specific.
