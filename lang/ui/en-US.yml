  <p><b>Image Sharing:</b> This site follows the principles of cooperative sharing pioneered
  by the "Free Software Foundation":http://fsf.org, further expressed by the "Open Source 
  software movement":http://opensource.org, and expanded to other creative efforts by the 
  "Creative Commons":http://creativecommons.org.  Consequently all images are made available 
  under one of the Creative Commons licenses.  In short this means that when anyone uploads 
  one of their images to the site, they are giving others explicit permission to use those 
  images under certain "conditions":%s in perpetuity.  This type of 
  permission is very important for basic research.  It allows future researchers to freely 
  use these data to expand our understanding of mushrooms.  It also significantly increases 
  the likelihood that the data will continue to be available into the distant future.
  </p><p>
  If you upload your own images, this license does not mean you are giving up your copyright 
  or your ability to make money off your images.  Depending on which license you choose, you 
  can still require that anyone who wishes to use any of these images for commercial purposes, 
  get in touch with the copyright holder and work out the conditions for that use.  The site 
  includes special links on the image pages to help create those relationships.</p>

intro_purpose: >
  <p><b>Purpose:</b> The purpose of this site is to record observations about mushrooms,
  help people identify mushrooms they aren't familiar with, and expand the community
  around the scientific exploration of mushrooms (mycology). Some have asked what counts
  as a mushroom. This site takes a very broad view. While the emphasis is on the large
  fleshy fungi, other fungi such as lichens, rust and molds as well as fungus-like organisms
  such as slime-molds are all welcome. Ultimately, I hope this site will become a valuable
  resource for both amateur and professional mycologists. I like to think of it as a living
  field guide for mushrooms or a collaborative mushroom field journal.
  </p><p>
  For those new to mycology, there is a huge amount of basic research that still needs to be
  done. By some estimates less that 5% of the world's species of fungi are known to science.
  While things are slightly better for the large fleshy fungi known as mushrooms, it is still
  a common experience to come across a mushroom that cannot be easily identified in the available
  books or which doesn't really fit the definition of any recognized species. This site is intended
  to address that gap by creating a place for us to talk about and record what we've found, as
  well as connect to the existing literature about mushrooms. Please do not feel intimidated
  by the scientific bent of the site. Everyone is welcome to dive in and add their own mushroom
  observations, upload mushroom photos and make comments on other people's observations.</p>
