  one of several possible strings, e.g. "Xanthoria OR Xanthomendoza".  Use a

# observer/color_themes
color_themes_text: >
  **General Concept:** The [:app_title] website provides a number of color
  themes based on different groups of mushrooms.  By default each page gets a
  randomly selected theme.  However, a [:user] can choose to use a particular
  theme throughout the site by selecting the theme on the [:user] preference page.
  \n\n
  The idea of using mushrooms for color follows in the tradition of using
  mushrooms to dye fabrics.  Each color in a theme was pulled from a photograph
  included in the site from the given group.  The colors attempt to express the
  characteristic colors of the group.  In a few cases, the [:images] were adjusted
  using an automatic color balance operation in order to get a more
  characteristic color.
  \n\n
  The following links describe each of the available themes including links to
  the [:images] the colors were extracted from:

  This page provides links to or shows the content that is currently scheduled
  for delivery to the "Encyclopedia of Life":http://eol.org (EOL).  The
  features related to this effort are still very new and far from polished
  since it has been implemented quickly to meet the immediate needs to develop
  the fungus related content on the EOL.  The content delivered from
  [:app_title] to the EOL will be credited both as coming from the [:app_title]
  website and the individual content providers.
  \n\n
  On this page each section represents one taxon.  The descriptive paragraphs
  for each listed taxon will be sent with the exception of any paragraphs
  marked 'Notes'.  Both the taxa and the images that are being sent have been
  at least quickly reviewed by expert members of the [:app_title]
  community.
  \n\n
  The review status of a specific taxon is given on the page for that taxon and
  can only be set by a designated expert.  Images are selected based on the
  voting history of specific observations and their quality.  Currently only
  designated experts can set the quality level of an image, but this is
  expected to become a open voting process for the entire [:app_title]
  community in the near future.
  \n\n
  Currently the designated experts are either mycology professors that are
  teaching classes that are planning to provide data to EOL through the
  [:app_title] or individuals in the [:app_title] community who have
  shown dedication to the site and are recognized experts in mushroom or fungal
  identification.  All aspect of the process of providing data to EOL are under
  discussion and open to change so please send any questions or comments you
  have to the [:app_title] webmaster.
  \n\n
  The best way to participate in this amazing opportunity is to find a taxon
  you care about and work to expand the descriptive paragraphs for this taxon.

  p(bulk_text). To ensure a name is in the database, just list the name.  E.g.,
  \n\n
  p(bulk_pre). Agaricus bisporus
  \n\n
  p(bulk_text). To ensure a name exists with a particular author, give the name
  followed by the author.  E.g.,
  \n\n
  p(bulk_pre). Agaricus bisporus (J.E. Lange) Pilát
  \n\n
  p(bulk_text). To add a taxon above the species level, give the rank followed
  by the name.  E.g.,
  \n\n
  p(bulk_pre). Order Agaricales
  \n\n
  p(bulk_text). To make a name a deprecated synonym of another name, follow
  the valid name with the deprecated synonym.  E.g.,
  \n\n
  p(bulk_pre). Agaricus bisporus (J.E. Lange) Pilát = Agaricus hortensis (Cke.)
  Imai
  \n\n
  The changes are cumulative, so the last example by itself would ensure that
  the names **__@Agaricus bisporus@__** @(J.E. Lange) Pilát@ and __@Agaricus
  hortensis@__ @(Cke.) Imai@ exist, as well as making __@A. hortensis@__ a
  deprecated synononym of **__@A. bisporus@__**.  If a name exists with no
  author and you provide an author, then the existing name is updated.
  Otherwise, if the author is given and it does not match the current author, a
  new name is created.
  \n\n
  p(bulk_text). You may include an optional one-line comment by inserting it
  after either the accepted or deprecated name, enclosed in square brackets.

# INTRO PAGE

# observer/intro
intro_title: Introduction
intro_purpose: >
  *Purpose:* The purpose of this site is to record observations about
  mushrooms, help people identify mushrooms they aren't familiar with, and
  expand the community around the scientific exploration of mushrooms
  (mycology).  Some have asked what counts as a mushroom.  This site takes a
  very broad view.  While the emphasis is on the large fleshy fungi, other
  fungi such as lichens, rust and molds as well as fungus-like organisms such
  as slime-molds are all welcome.  Ultimately, I hope this site will become a
  valuable resource for both amateur and professional mycologists.  I like to
  think of it as a living field guide for mushrooms or a collaborative mushroom
  field journal.
  \n\n
  For those new to mycology, there is a huge amount of basic research that
  still needs to be done.  By some estimates less that 5% of the world's
  species of fungi are known to science.  While things are slightly better for
  the large fleshy fungi known as mushrooms, it is still a common experience to
  come across a mushroom that cannot be easily identified in the available
  books or which doesn't really fit the definition of any recognized species.
  This site is intended to address that gap by creating a place for us to talk
  about and record what we've found, as well as connect to the existing
  literature about mushrooms.  Please do not feel intimidated by the scientific
  bent of the site.  Everyone is welcome to dive in and add their own mushroom
  observations, upload mushroom photos and make [:comments] on other people's
  observations.

intro_image_sharing: >
  *Image Sharing:* This site follows the principles of cooperative sharing
  pioneered by the "Free Software Foundation":http://fsf.org, further expressed
  by the "Open Source software movement":http://opensource.org, and expanded to
  other creative efforts by the "Creative Commons":http://creativecommons.org.
  Consequently all images are made available under one of the Creative Commons
  licenses.  In short this means that when anyone uploads one of their images
  to the site, they are giving others explicit permission to use those images
  under certain "conditions":/observer/how_to_use#license in perpetuity.  This
  type of permission is very important for basic research.  It allows future
  researchers to freely use these data to expand our understanding of
  mushrooms.  It also significantly increases the likelihood that the data will
  continue to be available into the distant future.
  \n\n
  If you upload your own images, this license does not mean you are giving up
  your copyright or your ability to make money off your images.  Depending on
  which license you choose, you can still require that anyone who wishes to use
  any of these images for commercial purposes, get in touch with the copyright
  holder and work out the conditions for that use.  The site includes special
  links on the image pages to help create those relationships.

  This page provides a list of skills that we could really use some help with.
  If you're interested in helping out just "send an

  h2. 1. Contributors
  \n\n
  p(normal).  Beyond adding pictures and descriptions of mushrooms that you've
  seen, you can make a big difference to the site by "describing
  species":/observer/how_to_use#describing_species or "defining
  locations":/observer/how_to_use#defining_locations.

how_help_designers: >
  h2. 2. Designers
  \n\n
  p(normal).  The site is pretty spare and could use an artisitc eye to help
  with things like icons and themes.

how_help_developers: >
  h2. 3. Developers
  \n\n
  p(normal).  We have "lots of ideas":[todo_list] about how to improve the
  site.  The framework, Ruby on Rails, is really easy to pick up and we are
  more than happy to mentor anyone who wants to dive in.

how_help_translators: >
  h2. 4. Translators
  \n\n
  p(normal). The site is set up to support foreign languages.  All we need is
  someone to do the translations.

how_help_business_planning: >
  h2. 5. Business Planning
  \n\n
  p(normal).  So far [:app_title] has been an entirely volunteer effort,
  we are looking for ways to make the site financially viable either as a
  non-profit or as part of a larger for-profit effort.

# HOW TO USE PAGE (COMMON TASKS)

# observer/how_to_use
how_title: How to Use [:app_title]
how_common_tasks: Common Tasks
how_glossary: Concepts Glossary

how_intro: >
  This page provides some short descriptions of common uses of this website
  followed by an overview of the basic concepts used.

how_keeping_up: >
  *Keeping Up with Changes* - The default page for [:app_title] is the
  '[:rss_log_title]', it is also accessible through the '"Latest Changes":/'
  link in the left-hand panel.  This page shows you the most recent changes on
  the site.  It lists new "Observations":#observation and "Species
  Lists":#species_list as well as significant changes to any already existing
  ones.  Additions of "Images":#image and "Comments":#comment are considered
  significant changes to the relevant observations.  Changes to "Names":#name
  are also listed.  Click the page numbers at the top and bottom of the page
  to browse through older changes.  Observations and names created as a side
  effect of other changes are not listed separately.
  \n\n
  Note: The latest changes can be tracked using our "RSS feed":/observer/rss.
  See this "wikipedia article":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss for more
  information about RSS feeds.

how_searching: >
  *Searching* - There are several interesting ways to search for information on
  the site.  The simplest is to type a search string into the search box near
  the top of each page and click one of the buttons next to it.  This will give
  you a list of all the "Observations":#observation, "Images":#image,
  "Names":#name or "Locations":#location that contain fields matching the given
  string.  If you need a little more control over the search, try clicking
  '[:app_advanced_search]'.
  \n\n
  You may also browse the site using the links in the left-hand panel.  For
  example, '[:app_index_a_z]' shows all the species that have observations,
  listed alphabetically.  You can page through this list, or skip directly to
  the letter of a name you are interested in by clicking the appropriate page
  number or letter along the top or bottom of the list.  Click a name from this
  list to see a description of the species and a list of observations of that
  species.  If you click a genus like 'Agaricus', it will also show a list of
  species in that genus.  Note, however, that in this case it will only show
  observations that have been identified to the genus level, not ones that have
  been identified as a species in that genus.  On the other hand, if two names
  are considered synonyms, you will see observations for either name on this
  page.  (*NOTE*: If you do a search on 'Agaricus', it _will_ show all the
  observations whose name contains that string, so you get all the observations
  that belong to that genus.)
  \n\n
  Whenever you click an observation or other result on an index page, it will
  take you to a page showing that result.  At the top of the page you will see
  '[:PREV]', '[:NEXT]', and '[:INDEX]' links.  These let you browse
  forward or backward through the results or return to the index.  At the top
  of the index page you will often see links allowing you to sort the results
  by different criteria, such as by date, name or user.  In the same place you
  will sometimes find links that let you turn an index of observations into an
  index of names or images of those same observations.  For example, if you
  click '[:app_your_observations]', it will show you a list of observations you
  have posted.  Click '[:show_objects(types=:names)]' at the top of the
  page to see a list of the species you have seen, or click
  '[:show_objects(types=:locations)]' to see a list of all the locations
  you've gone mushrooming in.
  \n\n
  Power users may also be interested in our new API providing direct access to
  our database back-end.  This can be used to mine our database for images or
  species descriptions for inclusion in wikipedia or other public websites.
  You can also use it to upload observations and images and much more.  Please
  contact the webmaster for more information.

how_unknown_help: >
  *Getting Help with an Unknown* - In order to get help with an unknown, you
  need to have a user account.  These can be created easily by selecting
  '[:app_create_account]' from the left-hand panel.  See the discussion of
  "Users":#user below for more details.
  \n\n
  Once you are logged in, create a new "Observation":#observation by selecting
  '[:app_create_observation]' in the left-hand panel.  Enter all the details
  you can into the resulting form.  You can leave the '[:WHAT]' field blank
  call it '[:unknown]', or if you think you know the genus or family or
  other group, give that "Name":#name followed by 'sp.', e.g., 'Russula sp.'.
  In the '[:NOTES]' field provide information about habitat, odor, smell
  and anything else not clear from the photos.  Once the form is as complete as
  you can make it, click '[:CREATE]'.
  \n\n
  You should now be looking at a page showing you the information you just
  entered.  However, if you used a name that is not currently in the database,
  you will be asked if you want to add the name.  This also gives you a chance
  to catch and fix typos.  In addition, if you use a name that is considered
  deprecated, you will be given the option of using a preferred synonym.
  \n\n
  Once you have created the new observation, you can upload any "Images":#image
  you have by selecting the '[:show_observation_add_images]' link on the
  right-side of the page.  It is very important either that it be an image you
  took or that you have the explicit permission of the person who created the
  image to upload it to the site.  If you did not take the image, please update
  the '[:form_images_copyright_holder]' field to reflect the actual owner.  This
  page also allows you to select the "License":#license you want to release the
  image under.
  \n\n
  When you add unknowns, the community will generally "propose one or more
  names":#proposing_names for it within 24-hours.  If you find any of the
  suggested names compelling, you should not hesitate to revisit your
  observation and "Vote":#vote on them.  Please see the discussion below on
  "voting":#voting, as well.  Members of the community may also post feedback
  via "Comments":#comment.  By default your account is set up to deliver
  comments posted about your observations to you by email.  If you are asked to
  provide more details on the collection, we prefer that you select
  '[:show_observation_edit_observation]' (at the top of the observation page)
  and add them to the '[:NOTES]' field than to just post another comment.

how_adding_observations: >
  *Adding Observations You Have Identified* - Use the same process as "Getting
  Help with an Unknown":#unknown_help, except this time provide your
  identification in the '[:WHAT]' field.  You are strongly encouraged to
  say something about how you arrived at the identification.  We've provided a
  small set of checkboxes to make this easy ('[:naming_reason_label_1]',
  '[:naming_reason_label_3]', etc.), but you are encouraged to elaborate on
  them in the provided text fields (e.g., list the references you used, or
  enter 'sequenced the DNA and compared it against the data in GenBank'!).
  Community members will often post "Comments":#comment if there is some
  question about the collection or if they would like clarification as to why
  you ruled out other "Names":#name.

how_proposing_names: >
  *Proposing Names* - Any member of the community can propose "Names":#name for
  any "Observations":#observation.  Click an observation (e.g., from the
  '[:rss_log_title]' page) and scroll down below the observation notes.  There
  should be a list of "Proposed Names":#proposed_name enclosed in a thin
  outlined box.  Most observations will already have at least one proposed name
  (by the owner).  From here you may either click
  '[:show_namings_propose_new_name]' or "Vote":#voting on existing names.  In
  either case you will have to log in before you are allowed to do so.
  \n\n
  When you click '[:show_namings_propose_new_name]' you will be presented with
  a form much like the one used to create an observation.  In addition to the
  name, you are required to choose a confidence level.  This is your
  "Vote":#vote, and you may change it on the
  '[:show_object(type=:observation)]' page at any time you like.  As with
  creating an observation, you are strongly encouraged to give some explanation
  as to why you think your Name applies to this Observation (and why other
  names don't).  When you are finished, click '[:CREATE]'.  You will be
  given a chance to correct typos or to choose an accepted name if you entered
  a deprecated one.
  \n\n
  Users are not allowed to propose a name if someone else has already done so.
  The only reason to do so would be to describe alternative reasons for
  reaching the same conclusion.  Instead use the discussion forum provided by
  comments to do this.

how_voting: >
  *Voting on Proposed Names* - Click an "Observation":#observation, e.g., from
  the '[:rss_log_title]' page, and scroll down to the
  '[:show_namings_proposed_names]' box.  Note that you must login before you
  can see or change any of your "Votes":#vote.  Once you have logged in, you
  should see pulldown menus next to each "Proposed Name":#proposed_name.  Your
  vote expresses the degree of confidence or agreement you have with placing
  that name on that observation.  Everything above '[min_neg_vote]' is
  considered a positive vote, everything below '[min_pos_vote]' negative.
  Choose '[no_opinion]' to tell it to delete your vote.  When you've changed
  all the votes you want to, be sure to click '[:show_namings_update_votes]' to
  record your votes.  Don't worry, if you forget and try to navigate away
  without casting your votes it will complain (unless you have Javascript
  disabled).
  \n\n
  Roughly speaking, votes for a name are weighted, summed and then divided by
  the number of votes for that name.  The name with the highest score wins, and
  that name will be applied to that observation throughout the site.  In the
  case where multiple synonyms are proposed for an observation it lumps the
  votes together, choosing each user's strongest vote within that group of
  synonyms.  In the end, assuming that group of synonyms wins, the currently
  accepted name is used as the community consensus.  If there is still debate
  in the scientific community about which name is appropriate for a given
  taxon, then it will use votes the best it can to decide between multiple
  accepted names.  Note that the owner's vote automatically carries a little
  more weight, as do the votes of users who have made a large
  "Contribution":#contribution to [:app_title] or who are considered
  experts.  Click '[:app_contributors]' or click a user's name to see the
  contribution and expert status.  (We use the log base 10 of users'
  contributions.)

how_adding_comments: >
  *Adding Comments* - When you are looking at an "Observation":#observation, if
  you would like to post or respond to a "Comment":#comment, select the
  '[:show_comments_add_comment]' link near the top of the page.  If you are
  not currently logged in to a "User":#user account, you will be asked to log
  in.  Once you are logged in, you will be given a form asking for a summary
  and your comment.  Note that you can do some simple formatting in the comment
  section.  This is briefly documented below the text field with a link to
  detailed documentation.  You can also add links within a comment using
  standard HTML formatting.  The HTML gets automatically cleaned to avoid
  security problems like script injection, so try not to get too fancy.

how_tracking_species: >
  *Tracking a Particular Species or Genus Through Email* - [:app_title]
  allows you to request an email any time a particular "Name":#name is given to
  an "Observation":#observation.  If that name is a genus or species it will
  also send you an email whenever a species or subspecies is observed.  To turn
  this feature on, go to the page for a Name you are interested in (see
  "Searching":#searching) and click '[:show_name_email_tracking]'.  You can
  configure it so that the person who made the observation that was given that
  name will be sent a customized email to let them know you are interested in
  their observation.  If you don't provide any instructions, they will not be
  sent an email.  If the observer gives the name at the time the observation is
  created, they will be shown your message immediately through the website.
  You can modify or disable your request for a particular name by going back to
  that name and again selecting '[:show_name_email_tracking]' and clicking the
  '[:DISABLE]' button on the page that comes up.

how_describing_species: >
  *Describing Species* - Click any "Name":#name link you see throughout the
  site.  For example, click any of the results listed in
  '"[:app_index_a_z]":/name/observation_index', search for a name in the search
  bar, or click the 'About &lt;name&gt;...' link at the top of any
  "Observation":#observation page.  These all take you to a page summarizing
  everything we know about this taxon.  If you are familiar with this species
  and there is something you would like to add, click
  '[:show_name_edit_name]' and add your notes.  You are encouraged to cite
  references including field guides and scientific papers.  Short quotes from
  references are fine, but please don't make extensive quotes without obtaining
  permission from the original author.

how_projects: >
  *Projects* - Projects are a way for a group of "Users":#user to work together
  to create a set of work that they want to keep out of the public eye until
  they are ready to publish it.  The original purpose was to support university
  classes where there was a desire to keep a more controlled environment while
  the class was going.
  \n\n
  Anyone can create a new project by clicking on
  '"[:app_list_projects]":/project/list_projects' in the left-hand panel and
  then clicking on '[:list_projects_add_project]'.  The person who creates the
  project is always a member and an administrator for that project.  An
  administrator for a project can add new members by clicking the
  '[:show_project_add_members]' link at the top of a project's 'Show Project'
  page.  Administrators can also make other users administrators for the
  project by going to one of the '[:add_members_change_status]' links available
  on the 'Show Project' or 'Add Members' pages.  Any User can send requests to
  the admins for a project.  These requests are emailed to the admins and
  contain a link for changing that user's status.
  \n\n
  Currently the primary focus of projects is writing
  "Descriptions":#description for various species.  Note, however, that anyone
  can now create new descriptions for a species (see "Describing
  Species":#describing_species) by clicking on
  '[:show_name_create_description]' at the top of the 'Show Name' page.
  Descriptions that are created for a project are visible only to members of
  that project until they are published, and editable only by the owner of the
  description and project administrators.  When a description is published it
  will become the official description if no official description exists yet.

how_maps: >
  *Working with Maps* - Currently there are three types of maps available on
  [:app_title]: Distribution Maps (e.g., "Distribution map for
  **__Craterellus cornucopioides__**":/name/map/284), Location Maps (e.g.,
  "Salt Point State Park":/location/show_location/4) and the
  "[:map_locations_global_map]":/location/map_locations.
  \n\n
  To see a distribution map for a particular "Name":#name, go to the page for
  that name (e.g., enter the name in the search bar and click
  '[:app_names_find]'), then click '[:show_name_distribution_map]' at the
  top of the page.
  \n\n
  "Users":#user are encouraged to add to the distribution map for a name.  The
  easiest way is to create a new "Observation":#observation using an already
  defined "Location":#location.  Note, however, that auto-completion for the
  '[:WHERE]' field will list all matching locations whether they are
  defined or not.
  \n\n
  You can also explicitly choose not to have an observation show up on the
  distribution map.  This allows you to record observations of mushrooms in
  places like mushroom fairs, old photos or other places where you may not know
  where the mushroom was actually collected.  When creating or editing an
  observation there is a checkbox labeled
  '[:form_observations_is_collection_location]'.  By default it is checked.  If
  you uncheck it, that observation will not appear in any distribution maps.

how_defining_locations: >
  *Defining Undefined Locations* - Many "Observations":#observation have been
  reported from undefined "Locations":#location.  These observations will not
  appear in our "distribution maps":#maps.  An excellent, easy way for
  "Users":#user to help out if they have a little spare time is to locate and
  defined these undefined locations.
  \n\n
  When browsing through observations, defined location names will be followed
  by a link labelled '[:click_for_map]'.  Undefined location names will be
  followed by a link labelled '[:SEARCH]'.  If you click the link for an
  undefined location, it will show a list of observations reported for that
  location.  The resulting page will include two links at the top of the page:
  '[:list_observations_location_define]' and '[:list_observations_location_merge]'.  Clicking on
  '[:list_observations_location_define]' will present a form which you can use to create that
  location.  Clicking on 'Merge With a Defined Location' will present you with
  a list of similar locations which have already been defined.  Clicking on any
  of these locations will perform the merge.
  \n\n
  You can also see a list of all locations in use by clicking on
  '"[:app_list_locations]":/location/list_locations' in the left-hand panel.
  This page lists both the defined locations (first column, sorted
  alphabetically) and the undefined locations (second column, sorted by the
  number of observations reported from that location).  In some cases the same
  location has been given multiple names (e.g., 'Point Reyes National Seashore'
  and 'Pt Reyes Park').  You can merge an undefined location with a defined
  location by clicking on '[:list_place_names_merge]' next to the undefined
  location (see above).
  \n\n
  When defining a new location, the first thing to do is to review its name.
  You are strongly encouraged to end each location with country.  In the USA
  you are also encouraged to include the full state name along with the county.
  Abbreviations are discouraged with the exception of 'Co.' for County.  Thus a
  good name is 'Salt Point State Park, Sonoma Co., California, USA' and a bad
  name would be 'Salt Point, CA'.  For other countries, we don't know enough to
  make a concrete proposal.  We expect conventions will evolve naturally over
  time.  In general, please define a location in increasing order of
  generality, that is, start with the specific place, followed by the local
  region, then broader regions, and end with the country.
  \n\n
  A location is a rectangular region defined by the northern, southern, eastern
  and western boundaries.  Part of intention of making locations areas rather
  than a single GPS readings is to allow people safeguard their secret 'spots'
  while still providing an approximate location that is at least accurate to
  the county.  We provide links to a couple of location finders to help in
  determining latitudes and longitudes.  These will open in a separate window
  or tab.  You can then search for or navigate to the appropriate area of the
  resulting map and read off the position.
  \n\n
  In theory it is possible for the same location to be defined more than once
  (presumably by different users).  If this happens, you can request a merge by
  editing one of the two locations and changing its name to be exactly the same
  as the other's.  This will not have any immediate effect, but it will display
  a warning message, and an email will be sent to the site administrators with
  the details.  Merging defined locations is restricted since it can cause
  significant data loss.

how_creating_species_lists: >
  *Creating Species Lists* - To create a "Species List":#species_list, click
  '"[:app_create_list]":/species_list/create_species_list' in the left-hand
  panel.  Fill out the various fields.  In the 'Write-In Species' field, you
  should give each species a "Name":#name on a line by itself.  When you go to
  create the list, each line is checked to see if there is a match in the
  database.  If there is no matching name, you will be asked if you want to add
  the unknown names to the database.  This gives you a chance to catch and fix
  typos as well as giving you a simple way to add missing names.  Each name
  given in the 'Write-In Species' field (or loaded from a file) will be used to
  create a completely new "Observation":#observation.  The
  '[:form_species_lists_list_notes]' are only shown when the entire species
  list is shown.  Use '[:form_species_lists_member_notes]' to indicate text you
  would like to add to each new observation.
  \n\n
  There are several methods of collecting a set of existing observations into a
  new list.  In the simplest method, first create an empty species list, then
  go to each of the observations you want to add and select
  '[:show_observation_manage_species_lists]'.  This will give you the
  opportunity to add that observation to any species list you own.  (Note, you
  can add anyone's observations to a species list you own.)
  \n\n
  In another method, you may select '[:app_create_list]' directly from any
  index of observations or names.  For example, you may use the search bar at
  the top of the page or the
  '"[:app_advanced_search]":/observer/advanced_search_form' feature to request
  all observations from Michigan.  When it shows you the first page of results,
  click '[:app_create_list]' (in the left-hand panel), and it will give you
  a list of all the matching names to choose from in the new species list form.
  \n\n
  Lastly, when you are viewing an existing species list, you may click
  '[:species_list_show_clone_list]' or '[:species_list_show_set_source]' at the
  top of the page.  '[:species_list_show_clone_list]' will take you directly to
  a new species list form, with all the information of the existing list
  already filled in.  '[:species_list_show_set_source]' will copy that species
  list's names to the clipboard.  The next time you click
  '[:app_create_list]', the new species list form will give you this list of
  names to choose from (unless you show another observation or name index in
  the meantime).

how_comment: >
  *Comment* - Comments are the standard way to discuss an
  "Observation":#observation or its associated "Images":#image.  Each comment
  is owned by a particular "User":#user.  A comment may only be edited or
  deleted by the owner or a site administrator.  You can look up all comments
  that have been made about your observations by clicking on
  '"[:show_user_comments_for_you]":/comment/show_comments_for_user' in the
  left-hand panel.

how_contribution: >
  *Contribution* - A number or score that measures the quantity and quality of
  contributions a "User":#user has made to [:app_title].  Click
  '[:app_your_summary]' to see a break-down of your own contribution.  You
  earn points for every "Observation":#observation, "Image":#image,
  "Comment":#comment, etc. you have posted.  "Describing
  Species":#describing_species and "Defining Locations":defining_locations are
  some of the most important contributions a user can make.  (See "How To
  Help":/observer/how_to_help for a list of other ways to help out.)
  Currently, contribution is used only in weighting your "Votes":#vote when
  voting on "Proposed Names":#proposed_names for observations.

how_description: >
  *Species Description* - A collection of text describing a "Name":#name.
  Every name automatically gets one official description that everyone in the
  community is allowed to read and modify.  Additional descriptions may be
  created by any "User":#user, including project members.  The owner of a
  description may choose any level of read or write permissions, and can
  control who is given authorship credit.  Since descriptions, especially the
  official one, are often collaborative efforts, modifications by a user are
  subject to community review, and past versions are kept to facilitate this
  process.  The content of a description includes a set list of sections,
  including things like '[:form_names_gen_desc]', '[:form_names_diag_desc]',
  '[:form_names_look_alikes]', '[:form_names_refs]' and other notes.

how_image: >
  *Image* - A photograph or illustration of one or more mushroom species.
  Images are associated with one or more "Observations":#observation.  A given
  Image is owned by a particular "User":#user who may or may not be the
  copyright holder.  Only the owner or a site administrator can remove an image
  or edit the associated information.  All images in the site are required to
  be released under one of the "Creative Commons
  licenses":http://creativecommons.org.  If you dispute the given copyright or
  the licensing of an image you are the copyright holder of, send mail to the
  "webmaster":/observer/ask_webmaster_question.

how_license: >
  *License* - "Images":#image on [:app_title] are posted with an explicit
  license.  The current options are the "Creative Commons Attribution, Share
  Alike License":http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ and the
  "Creative Commons Attribution, Non-Commercial, Share Alike
  License":http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/.  The primary
  difference is whether the image can be used in any potentially commercial
  setting.  One of the side effects of selecting the non-commercial license is
  that your image cannot be used on "Wikipedia":http://wikipedia.org.  The
  license can be set on a per image basis.  The looser, Wikipedia compatible
  license is the default for new "Users":#user.  However, you can select the
  non-commercial license to be your default by selecting it on your
  '"[:app_preferences]":/account/prefs' page and clicking on
  '[:SAVE_CHANGES]'.

how_location: >
  *Location* - A rectangular region enclosing a given location, as defined by
  the northern, southern, eastern and western boundaries.  In addition to the
  position, locations can also include a minimum and maximum elevation along
  with various notes.  Note that the elevations should be in meters not feet.
  A location is not considered to be owned by a particular "User":#user.  Any
  user may change or define any location, but all of a user's changes are
  subject to review by the community.  To help with this review process, copies
  of the previous versions are kept.

how_name: >
  *Name* - A name for some group of mushrooms.  Most commonly this is the name
  of a species, but it can be any taxon (genus, family, variety, etc.).  Names
  can also refer to groups that are not officially recognized scientific names
  such as common names or functional groups like Gasteromyces.  A name is *not*
  considered to be owned by a particular "User":#user.  Any user may change any
  name, but all changes are subject to review by the community.  To help with
  this review process, copies of previous versions are kept.  Names can have an
  acknowledged author.  The author is normally only given for scientific names.
  The author should follow the standard practice of listing the person who
  first correctly published the name.  In the case of names at or below the
  species level, the author may also include the person who transfered the
  species to the current genus, e.g., (Singer) Jenkins.

how_observation: >
  *Observation* - A record of a single mushroom species at a particular time
  and "Location":#location.  Typically associated with one or more
  "Names":#name (see "Proposed Name":#proposed_name below) and some number of
  "Images":#image.  Each observation is owned by a "User":#user, and can only
  be edited or deleted by that user or a site administrator.  However, any user
  may post "Comments":#comment about any observation.  Observations can also be
  included in one or more "Species Lists:#species_list.

how_proposed_name: >
  *Proposed Name* - A "Name":#name as proposed for a given
  "Observation":#observation.  Any number of names may be proposed for a single
  observation by members of the community.  No special treatment is given to
  any member's name.  Community consensus is arrived at through the process of
  "voting":#voting.  Each proposed name for an observation is owned by a single
  "User":#user.  However, even the user who proposed the name cannot
  necessarily modify or delete a name once other members of the community have
  cast "Votes":#vote for or against it.  Fortunately you may always propose
  additional names.  There is never any sort of penalty associated with
  proposing incorrect names.

how_species_list: >
  *Species List* - A list of "Observations":#observation (not "Names":#name).
  Includes a date, a "Location":#location and a title for the list.  A given
  species list is owned by a particular "User":#user.  Only the owner or a site
  administrator can change or delete a species list.  There are no strict rules
  for how species lists should be used.  This is an area that is likely to
  change in the future as the community comes up with clearer ideas for how
  they should be used.

how_user: >
  *User* - An account on [:app_title].  You are required to provide a
  valid email address when you first create an account.  This allows the system
  to stop automated programs from creating bogus accounts.  It also provides a
  way for other users to get in touch with you.  However, your email address
  will never be revealed unless you request an email be sent to another user
  and then only to that user.  If you are concerned about having your email
  address in our database, once you have verified your account, you can go to
  the '"[:app_preferences]":/account/prefs' page and remove your address.

how_vote: >
  *Vote* - One "User's":#user vote on a "Proposed Name":#proposed_name for a
  given "Observation":#observation.  Expresses a level of confidence or
  agreement with that name, with half the choices ("[min_pos_vote]" and up)
  being positive and half ("[min_neg_vote]" and below) being negative.  Votes
  are owned by that user, and can only be changed or deleted by the owner or a
  site administrator.
