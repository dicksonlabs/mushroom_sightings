  <p>Thanks for your interest in the Mushroom Observer website.  This website was
  first launched in mid-2006.  I am currently the primary (but no longer only!)
  developer and maintainer.
  I welcome any questions you might have about using the site or comments on how
  the site might be improved.  I keep my "to do list":%s online so you can
  get a peek into what I have planned and a rough order.  However, this is always
  subject to change, especially if there is some type of bug or someone submits
  a really great idea.</p><p>

# observer/how_to_use
how_adding_comments: >
  <p><b>Adding Comments</b> - When you are looking at an 
  <a href="#observation">Observation</a> you select the 'Add Comment' link near 
  the top of the page.  If you are not currently logged into a <a href="#user">User</a> 
  account, you will be asked to log in.  Once you are logged in, you will be given a 
  form asking for a Summary and your Comment.  Note that you can do some simple 
  formating in the Comment section.  This is briefly documented below the Comment 
  section with a link to detailed documentation.  You can also add links within a 
  Comment using standard HTML formatting.  The HTML gets automatically cleaned to 
  avoid security problems like script injection, so try not to get too fancy.</p>
  
how_adding_observations: >
  <p><b>Adding Observations You Have Identified</b> - Use the same process as 
  'Getting Help with an Unknown', except you provide your identification in the 
  'What' field.  You are strongly encouraged to say something about how you 
  arrived at the identification ('identified by sight', 'used the key in Mushrooms 
  Demystified', 'sequenced the DNA and compared it against the data in GenBank' 
  etc.).  In general you will only get <a href="#comment">Comments</a> if someone 
  has a question about the collection or a suggestion for a different 
  <a href="#name">Name</a>.</p>

how_comment: >
  <p><b>Comment</b> - A User's comment on a particular Observation.  Comment are the 
  standard way to discuss an Observation or its associated Images.  A given Comment 
  is owned by a particular User.  A Comment can only be edited or deleted by the owner 
  or a site administrator.  You can look up all Comments that have been made about 
  Observations you own, but clicking 'Comments for You' from the left-hand panel.</p>
  
how_common_tasks: Common Tasks

how_creating_species_lists: >
  <p><b>Creating Species Lists</b> - Select 'Create List' from the left-hand panel.
  Fill out the various fields.  In the 'Species' field, you should give each species 
  name on a line by itself.  When you go to create the <a href="#species_list">Species List</a> 
  each line will be checked to see if there is a match in the database.  If there is 
  no matching <a href="#name">Name</a>, then you will be asked if you want to add the 
  unknown names to the database.  This gives you a chance to catch and fix typos as well 
  as a simple way to add missing names.  Each name given in the 'Species' field or loaded 
  from a file will create a completely new observation.  The 'Species List Notes' are only 
  shown when the entire species list is shown.  The 'Notes for each new member' are actually 
  added as the 'Notes' field to each newly created <a href="#observation">Observation</a>.</p>
  <p>If you wish to collect a set of existing <a href="#observation">Observations</a> into 
  a new list, first create an empty Species List.  Then go to each of the Observations you 
  want to add and select 'Manage Species Lists'.  This will given you the opportunity to add 
  that Observation to any Species Lists you have created.</p>
  <p>If you visit another Species List before you create or edit another one, you will 
  automatically get a checklist of species from the first list to select and add to the 
  list you are creating or editing.</p>

how_glossary: Concepts Glossary

how_image: >
  <p><b>Image</b> - A photograph or illustration of one or more mushroom species.  Images 
  are associated with one or more Observations.  A given Image is owned by a particular 
  User who may or may not be the copyright holder.  Only the owner or a site administrator 
  can remove an Image or edit the associated information.  All Images in the site are required 
  to be released under one of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons licenses</a>.
  If you dispute the given copyright or the licensing of an image you are the copyright holder of,
  send mail to the "webmaster":%s.</p>

how_intro: >
  This page provides a some short descriptions of common uses for the site followed by an overview of basic concepts used in the website.

how_keeping_up: >
  <p><b>Keeping Up with Changes</b> - The default page for MushroomObserver.org is the 
  'Activity Log', it is also accessible through the 'Latest Changes' link on the left 
  side of the screen.  This page lets you know what the most recent changes to the site 
  are.  It lists new <a href="#observation">Observations</a> and 
  <a href="#species_list">Species Lists</a> as well as significant changes to any already 
  existing ones.  Additions of <a href="#image">Images</a> or <a href="#comment">Comments</a> 
  are considered significant changes to the relevant <a href="#observation">Observations</a>.
  Changes to <a href="#name">Names</a> are also listed.  The numbers at the top and bottom 
  of the page let you look through older changes.  <a href="#observation">Observations</a> 
  and <a href="#name">Names</a> created as a side effect of other changes are not separately 
  listed.</p>
  <p>In addition, the latest changes can be tracked using the 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss_feed">RSS feed</a> provided by the site.</p>

how_license: >
  <p><b>License</b> - Images on the Mushroom Observer website are put under an explicit license.
  The current options are the 
  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution, Share Alike License</a> 
  and the 
  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution, Non-Commercial, Share Alike License</a>.
  The primary difference is whether the image can be used in any potentially commercial setting.
  One of the side effects of selecting the non-commercial license is that your image cannot be 
  used on Wikipedia.  The license can be set on a per image basis.  The looser, Wikipedia 
  compatible license is the default for new users.  However, you can select the non-commercial 
  license to be your default by selecting it on your Preferences page and clicking 'Save'.</p>

how_name: >
  <p><b>Name</b> - A name for some group of mushrooms.  Most commonly this is the name of a species, 
  but it can be any taxon (genus, family, variety etc.).  Names can also refer to groups that are 
  not officially recognized scientific names such as common names or functional groups like Gasteromyces.
  A Name is <em>not</em> considered to be owned by a particular User.  Any User may change a Name, but 
  all changes are associated with a User and are reviewed by the community.  To help with this review 
  process, copies of previous versions of a Name are kept.  Names can have an acknowledged author.  
  The author is normally only given for scientific names.  The author should follow the standard 
  practice of listing the person who first correctly published the name.  In the case of names at 
  or below the species level, the author may also includes the person who transfered the species to 
  the current genus, e.g., (Singer) Jenkins.</p>

how_observation: >
  <p><b>Observation</b> - A record of a single mushroom species at a particular time and 
  place seen by a particular person.  Typically associated with a mushroom Name along with 
  some number of Images, Comments and Species Lists.  A given Observation is owned by a 
  particular User.  An Observation can only be edited or deleted by the owner or a site 
  administrator.</p>

how_searching: >
  <p><b>Searching</b> - There are two interesting ways to search for information in the site.
  The simplest is to type a search string into the Search Box near the top of each page and 
  click one of the buttons next to Search Box.  This will give you a list of all the 
  <a href="#observation">Observations</a>, <a href="#image">Images</a> or 
  <a href="#name">Names</a> who contain fields matching the given string.</p>
  <p>You can also browse all the names currently in the database by clicking on the 
  'Name Index' link on the left-side of the screen.  Currently 
  <a href="#observation">Observations</a> are only assigned to a single <a href="#name">Name</a>.
  This means when you browse through the Name Index, it only lists observations that have 
  been assigned to that name.  For example, the genus <i>Agaricus</i> only lists those 
  observations that are in the genus, but have not been identified to species.  It does 
  not list all the observations that have been given the name of a species within that 
  genus.  However, if two <a href="#name">Names</a> are considered synonyms, then you can 
  access observations for either from their Name Page.  In the case of the Search Box, if 
  you give 'Agaricus' then all observations whose name  contains that string are listed so 
  you get all observations that have belong to that genus.</p>

how_species_list: >
  <p><b>Species List</b> - A list of Observations.  Includes a date, a location and a 
  title for the list.  A given Species List is owned by a particular User.  Only the 
  owner or a site administrator can change or delete a Species List.  There are no 
  strict rules for how Species Lists should be used.  This is an area that is likely 
  to change in the future as the community comes up with clearer ideas for how lists 
  should get used.</p>

how_title: How to Use Mushroom Observer

how_unknown_help: >
  <p><b>Getting Help with an Unknown</b> - In order to get help with an unknown, you need to 
  have a <a href="#user">User</a> account.  These can be created easily by selecting 
  'New Account' from the left-hand panel.  See the discussion of <a href="#user">Users</a> 
  below for more details.</p>
  <p>Once you are logged in, create a new <a href="#observation">Observation</a> by selecting 
  'Create Observation' from the left-hand panel.  Put all the details you can into the 
  resulting form.  In the 'What' field you can give 'Unknown' or if you think you know the 
  genus or family or other group, give that name followed by 'sp.', e.g. Russula sp.  In 
  the 'Notes' field provide information about habitat, odor, smell and any details you can.
  Once the form is as complete as you can make it, click 'Create'.</p>
  <p>You should now be looking at a page showing you the information you just entered.
  However, if you used a name that is not currently in the database, you will be asked if 
  you want to add the name.  This also gives you a chance to catch and fix typos.  In 
  addition, if you a name that is considered deprecated, you will be given the option to 
  use a preferred synonym.</p>
  <p>Once you have created the new observation, you can upload any images you have by 
  selecting the 'Add Image' link on the right-side of the window.  It is very important 
  that it be either an image you took or that you have the explicit permission of the 
  person who created the image to upload it to the site.  If you did not take the image, 
  please update the 'Copyright Holder' field to reflect the actual owner.  This page also 
  allows you to select the <a href="#lic">license</a> you want to release the image under.</p>
  <p>When you add unknowns, you will generally see some sort of <a href="#comment">Comment</a> 
  added to your <a href="#observation">Observation</a> within 24-hours.  If you find any of 
  the suggested names compelling, you should select the 'Edit' link and update the 'What' 
  field.  If you are asked to provide more details on the collection, it is better to select 
  'Edit' and add them to the 'Notes' field than to just add another comment.</p>

how_user: >
  <p><b>User</b> - An account on MushroomObserver.org created by someone.  You are required 
  to provide a valid email address when you first create an account.  This allows the system 
  to stop automated programs from creating bogus accounts.  It also provides a way for other 
  people to get in touch with you.  However, your email address will never be revealed unless 
  you request an email be sent to another User and then only to that User.  If you are 
  concerned about having your email address in the MushroomObserver.org database, once you 
  have verified your account, you can go to the Preferences page and remove your address.</p>


# observer/intro
intro_image_sharing: >
  <p><b>Image Sharing:</b> This site follows the principles of cooperative sharing pioneered
  by the "Free Software Foundation":http://fsf.org, further expressed by the "Open Source 
  software movement":http://opensource.org, and expanded to other creative efforts by the 
  "Creative Commons":http://creativecommons.org.  Consequently all images are made available 
  under one of the Creative Commons licenses.  In short this means that when anyone uploads 
  one of their images to the site, they are giving others explicit permission to use those 
  images under certain "conditions":%s in perpetuity.  This type of 
  permission is very important for basic research.  It allows future researchers to freely 
  use these data to expand our understanding of mushrooms.  It also significantly increases 
  the likelihood that the data will continue to be available into the distant future.
  </p><p>
  If you upload your own images, this license does not mean you are giving up your copyright 
  or your ability to make money off your images.  Depending on which license you choose, you 
  can still require that anyone who wishes to use any of these images for commercial purposes, 
  get in touch with the copyright holder and work out the conditions for that use.  The site 
  includes special links on the image pages to help create those relationships.</p>

intro_note: >
  <p>Note: The administrators of this site reserve the right to remove any material they deem 
  inappropriate or not in keeping with the purpose of this site.</p>

intro_purpose: >
  <p><b>Purpose:</b> The purpose of this site is to record observations about mushrooms,
  help people identify mushrooms they aren't familiar with, and expand the community
  around the scientific exploration of mushrooms (mycology). Some have asked what counts
  as a mushroom. This site takes a very broad view. While the emphasis is on the large
  fleshy fungi, other fungi such as lichens, rust and molds as well as fungus-like organisms
  such as slime-molds are all welcome. Ultimately, I hope this site will become a valuable
  resource for both amateur and professional mycologists. I like to think of it as a living
  field guide for mushrooms or a collaborative mushroom field journal.
  </p><p>
  For those new to mycology, there is a huge amount of basic research that still needs to be
  done. By some estimates less that 5% of the world's species of fungi are known to science.
  While things are slightly better for the large fleshy fungi known as mushrooms, it is still
  a common experience to come across a mushroom that cannot be easily identified in the available
  books or which doesn't really fit the definition of any recognized species. This site is intended
  to address that gap by creating a place for us to talk about and record what we've found, as
  well as connect to the existing literature about mushrooms. Please do not feel intimidated
  by the scientific bent of the site. Everyone is welcome to dive in and add their own mushroom
  observations, upload mushroom photos and make comments on other people's observations.</p>
