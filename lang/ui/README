To start translating into a new language, pick any of these files, and start
translating.  There are comments at the top of each file that explain the
format.  A little.  For the most part, just try to keep the formatting the
same, but there are a few things you need to know:

  [brackets]    These are special -- do not translate these!!  (see below)
  \n\n          Force the extra blank line Textile requires between paragraphs.
  <<hola>>      Double angle-brackets get translated into angle-quotes.

There are a few points of syntax that are important.  We will correct these
ourselves, but it would still help if you knew the rules.  The basic structure
is simply a list of "keys" and "values":

  key: value
  key: >
    Multiline values are terminated by a single blank line.

There are a few important things to watch:

1) Keys are fixed -- these are what the code uses to look up text for the site.

2) Square brackets and quotes can potentially confuse YAML.  When in doubt,
enclose your value with single or double-quotes:

  key: 'About: [name]'
  key: 'I said "hello".'
  key: "Click on 'Save'."

3) Most (but not all) values will be "Textilized", allowing you to include
formatting and links and such as you normally would when entering notes on the
site.  But note that internal links like _Agaricus_ will not, in general, work.

  key: This is __really__ cool!
  key: You can use "Textile":/observer/textile mark-up in these files.

4) Many translations allow on-the-fly substitutions.  We use [brackets] to hold
the place of an arbitrary string that will be inserted at run-time:

  key: Editing Observation #[id]
  key: Please check our "todo list":[svn_repo]/trunk/TODO.
  key: Cancel (Show [object])
  key: Last Updated on [date] by [user].

5) We use a dorky convention to make it easy to see which values have not been
translated yet.  If the colon is followed by one space it has been translated,
if it is followed by more than one it has not.

  key: translated
  key:  untranslated
