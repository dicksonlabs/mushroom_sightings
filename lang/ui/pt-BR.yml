# observer/color_themes
color_themes_text:  >
  **General Concept:** The Mushroom Observer website provides a number of color
  themes based on different groups of mushrooms.  By default each page gets a
  randomly selected theme.  However, a user can choose to use a particular
  theme throughout the site by selecting the theme on the user preference page.
  \n\n
  The idea of using mushrooms for color follows in the tradition of using
  mushrooms to dye fabrics.  Each color in a theme was pulled from a photograph
  included in the site from the given group.  The colors attempt to express the
  characteristic colors of the group.  In a few cases, the images were adjusted
  using an automatic color balance operation in order to get a more
  characteristic color.
  \n\n
  The following links describe each of the available themes including links to
  the images the colors were extracted from:

  This page provides links to or shows the content that is currently scheduled
  for delivery to the "Encyclopedia of Life":http://eol.org (EOL).  The
  features related to this effort are still very new and far from polished
  since it has been implemented quickly to meet the immediate needs to develop
  the fungus related content on the EOL.  The content delivered from Mushroom
  Observer to the EOL will be credited both as coming from the Mushroom
  Observer website and the individual content providers.
  \n\n
  On this page each section represents one taxon.  The descriptive paragraphs
  for each listed taxon will be sent with the exception of any paragraphs
  marked 'Notes'.  Both the taxa and the images that are being sent have been
  at least quickly reviewed by expert members of the Mushroom Observer
  community.
  \n\n
  The review status of a specific taxon is given on the page for that taxon and
  can only be set by a designated expert.  Images are selected based on the
  voting history of specific observations and their quality.  Currently only
  designated experts can set the quality level of an image, but this is
  expected to become a open voting process for the entire Mushroom Observer
  community in the near future.
  \n\n
  Currently the designated experts are either mycology professors that are
  teaching classes that are planning to provide data to EOL through the
  Mushroom Observer or individuals in the Mushroom Observer community who have
  shown dedication to the site and are recognized experts in mushroom or fungal
  identification.  All aspect of the process of providing data to EOL are under
  discussion and open to change so please send any questions or comments you
  have to the Mushroom Observer webmaster.
  \n\n
  The best way to participate in this amazing opportunity is to find a taxon
  you care about and work to expand the descriptive paragraphs for this taxon.

  p(bulk_text). To ensure a name is in the database, just list the name.  E.g.,
  \n\n
  p(bulk_pre). Agaricus bisporus
  \n\n
  p(bulk_text). To ensure a name exists with a particular author, give the name
  followed by the author.  E.g.,
  \n\n
  p(bulk_pre). Agaricus bisporus (J.E. Lange) Pilát
  \n\n
  p(bulk_text). To add a taxon above the species level, give the rank followed
  by the name.  E.g.,
  \n\n
  p(bulk_pre). Order Agaricales
  \n\n
  p(bulk_text). To make a name a deprecated synonym of another name, follow
  the valid name with the deprecated synonym.  E.g.,
  \n\n
  p(bulk_pre). Agaricus bisporus (J.E. Lange) Pilát = Agaricus hortensis (Cke.)
  Imai
  \n\n
  The changes are cumulative, so the last example by itself would ensure that
  the names **__@Agaricus bisporus@__** @(J.E. Lange) Pilát@ and __@Agaricus
  hortensis@__ @(Cke.) Imai@ exist, as well as making __@A. hortensis@__ a
  deprecated synononym of **__@A. bisporus@__**.  If a name exists with no
  author and you provide an author, then the existing name is updated.
  Otherwise, if the author is given and it does not match the current author, a
  new name is created.
  \n\n
  p(bulk_text). You may include an optional one-line comment by inserting it
  after either the accepted or deprecated name, enclosed in square brackets.
  This will be saved in the notes when the name is created.

  It looks like your browser is refusing cookies.  Without cookies, our site
  has no way of remembering who you are from one page to the next.  This means
  that you will not be able to create an account and login, and therefore you
  will not be able to create observations, upload images, make comments, and
  much more.  You will still be able to view everything that the general public
  has access to, but you will just be an observer, you will not be able to
  participate actively.
  \n\n
  All we will do is store a big long number on your computer.  Next time you go
  to our site, we will look up that number and use it to keep track of who you
  are.  (We get multiple requests every second from around the world -- without
  this ID we wouldn't stand a chance of keeping everyone straight!)  This ID is
  encrypted and keeps no sensitive information in it.

  There is somewhere around 1600 lines or 11000 words of text on this site at
  the moment, but don't let that scare you.  We've organized it so someone with
  limited time can concentrate on just the first few sections, and get the most
  commonly-used text done first.  Then as time and energy permits, they or
  someone else can continue working down the list until one day it is all
  finished.  Please feel free to pick up a copy of the "translation
  files":[repo] and start plugging away in any language you wish.  Then just
  "pop us an email":/observer/ask_webmaster_question when you finish doing what

  The order is currently based on an automated estimation of what each person

  recognize the individual contributions of the members of the
  MushroomObserver.org community.
  \n\n
  The current formula is a weighted sum of each contribution.  The current
  weighting is:

  Thus an observation of a species not previously in the site with 3 images
  would count as:

users_by_contribution_2a:  images

users_by_contribution_2d:  proposed ID
users_by_contribution_2e:  vote on ID

  These weights or the overall method of ranking is likely to change over time

# observer/intro
intro_title: Introdução
intro_purpose: >
  *Propósito:* O propósito deste site é registrar observações de
  cogumelos, ajudar pessoas a identificar cogumelos que lhes são familiar e
  expandir a comunidade de exploração científica de cogumelos (micologia).
  Alguns perguntam o que é considerado cogumelo. Este site tem uma visão bem
  ampla. Mesmo com ênfase em fungos carnudos e grandes, outros fundos como
  líquens, uredinales e mofos, assim como organismos parecidos com fungos como
  mofo-limo são bem-vindos. Últimamente eu tenho esperado que este site se
  torne uma fonte valiosa de conhecimento tanto para micologistas amadores
  como para profissionais. Eu gosto de pensar nele como um guia vivo de
  cogumelos ou como um jornal colaborativo sobre cogumelos.
  \n\n
  Para os iniciantes na micologia, existe um grande montante de pesquisas
  básicas que precisam ser feitas. As estimativas são de que menos de 5% das
  espécies de fungos do planeta são conhecidos pela ciência. Enquanto as coisas
  são ligeiramente melhores para os grandes e carnudos fungos conhecidos como
  cogumelos, continua sendo comum a experiência de cruzar cogumelos que não
  são facilmente identificáveis nos livros disponíveis ou que simplesmente não
  combinam completamente com a definição de qualquer espécie catalogada. Este
  site tem o intuito de preencher essa lacuna criando um lugar para
  discutirmos e registrarmos o que encontramos, bem como nos conectar à
  corrente literatura sobre cogumelos. Por favor, não se sinta intimidado pela
  encurvatura ciêntifica do site. Todos são bem-vindos a compartilhar suas
  próprias observações, colocar suas fotos e a fazer comentários nas
  observações de outras pessoas.

  *Compartilhando Imagens:* Este site segue os mesmos princípios
  cooperativos iniciados pela "Free Software Foundation":http://fsf.org,

  de permissão é muito importante para certos tipos de pesquisa. Isto permite
  que futuros pesquisadores possam usar livremente essas informações para
  expandir o conhecimento sobre cogumelos.  Além disso, aumenta a probabilidade
  de que essas informações continuem disponíveis num futuro distante.

  detailed documentation.  You can also add links within a Comment using
  standard HTML formatting.  The HTML gets automatically cleaned to avoid
  security problems like script injection, so try not to get too fancy.

how_adding_observations:  >
  *Adding Observations You Have Identified* - Use the same process as "Getting
  Help with an Unknown":#unknown_help, except you provide your
  identification in the 'What' field.  You are strongly encouraged to say
  something about how you arrived at the identification.  We've provided a
  small set of checkboxes to make this easy (e.g., 'Identified by sight',
  'Based on microscopic features'), but you are encouraged to elaborate on them
  in the provided text fields (e.g., list the references you used, or say
  'sequenced the DNA and compared it against the data in GenBank').  Community
  members will often post "Comments":#comment if there is some question about
  the collection or they would like clarification as to why you ruled out other
  "Names":#name.

how_comment:  >
  *Comment* - A User's Comment on a particular Observation.  Comments are the
  standard way to discuss an "Observation":#observation or its associated
  "Images":#image.  A given Comment is owned by a particular "User":#user.  A
  Comment can only be edited or deleted by the owner or a site administrator.
  You can look up all Comments that have been made about Observations you own
  by clicking 'Comments for You' from the left-hand panel.

how_common_tasks:  Common Tasks
how_creating_species_lists:  >
  *Creating Species Lists* - Select 'Create List' from the left-hand panel.
  Fill out the various fields.  In the 'Species' field, you should give each
  species a "Name":#name on a line by itself.  When you go to create the
  "Species List":#species_list each line will be checked to see if there is a
  match in the database.  If there is no matching "Name":#name, then you will
  be asked if you want to add the unknown Names to the database.  This gives
  you a chance to catch and fix typos as well as a simple way to add missing
  Names.  Each Name given in the 'Species' field or loaded from a file will
  create a completely new Observation.  The 'Species List Notes' are only shown
  when the entire species list is shown.  The 'Notes for each new member' are
  actually added as the 'Notes' field to each newly created
  "Observation":#observation.
  \n\n
  If you wish to collect a set of existing "Observations":#observation into a
  new list, first create an empty Species List.  Then go to each of the
  Observations you want to add and select 'Manage Species Lists'.  This will
  given you the opportunity to add that Observation to any Species Lists you
  have created.
  \n\n
  If you visit one Species List before you create or edit another one, you will
  automatically get a checklist of species from the first list to select and
  add to the list you are creating or editing.

how_describing_species:  >
  *Describing Species* - Select "Index A->Z":/name/observation_index from the
  left-hand panel and select a Name or click any "About &lt;name&gt;..." link
  you see.  Read over any notes that already exist for that Name.  If you know
  anything else about this species you want included, click 'Edit Description'
  and add your notes.  You are encouraged to cite references including field
  guides and scientific papers.  Short quotes from references are fine, but
  please don't make extensive quotes without checking with the permission of
  the original author.

how_glossary:  Concepts Glossary
how_image:  >
  *Image* - A photograph or illustration of one or more mushroom species.
  Images are associated with one or more "Observations":#observation.  A given
  Image is owned by a particular "User":#user who may or may not be the
  copyright holder.  Only the owner or a site administrator can remove an Image
  or edit the associated information.  All Images in the site are required to
  be released under one of the "Creative Commons
  licenses":http://creativecommons.org.  If you dispute the given copyright or
  the licensing of an image you are the copyright holder of, send mail to the
  "webmaster":/observer/ask_webmaster_question.

how_intro:  >
  This page provides a some short descriptions of common uses for the site followed by an
  overview of basic concepts used in the website.

how_keeping_up:  >
  *Keeping Up with Changes* - The default page for MushroomObserver.org is the
  'Activity Log', it is also accessible through the 'Latest Changes' link on
  the left side of the screen.  This page lets you know what the most recent
  changes to the site are.  It lists new "Observations":#observation and
  "Species Lists"#species_list as well as significant changes to any already
  existing ones.  Additions of "Images":#image or "Comments":#comment are
  considered significant changes to the relevant Observations.  Changes to
  "Names":#name are also listed.  The numbers at the top and bottom of the page
  let you look through older changes.  Observations and Names created as a side
  effect of other changes are not listed separately.
  \n\n
  In addition, the latest changes can be tracked using the "RSS
  feed":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss_feed provided by the site.

how_license:  >
  *License* - Images on the Mushroom Observer website are put under an explicit
  license.  The current options are the "Creative Commons Attribution, Share
  Alike License":http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ and the
  "Creative Commons Attribution, Non-Commercial, Share Alike
  License":http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/.  The primary
  difference is whether the Image can be used in any potentially commercial
  setting.  One of the side effects of selecting the non-commercial license is
  that your Image cannot be used on "Wikipedia":http://wikipedia.org.  The
  license can be set on a per Image basis.  The looser, Wikipedia compatible
  license is the default for new Users.  However, you can select the
  non-commercial license to be your default by selecting it on your Preferences
  page and clicking 'Save'.

how_location:  >
  *Location* - A place in the world.  Defined Locations associate a location
  name with the extreme north and south latitudes and west and east longitudes
  of that location.  Defined Locations can also have a maximum and minimum
  altitude and notes.  Undefined Locations just have a name.  A Location is not
  considered to be owned by a particular User.  Any "User":#user may change or
  define a Location, but all changes are associated with a User and are
  reviewed by the community.  To help with this review process, copies of
  previous versions of a Location are kept.

how_maps:  >
  *Working with Maps* - Currently there are three types of maps available on
  Mushroom Observer: Distribution Maps (e.g., "Distribution map for
  **__Craterellus cornucopioides__**":/name/map/284), Location Maps (e.g.,
  "Salt Point State Park":/location/show_location/4) and the "Global
  Map":/location/map_locations.
  \n\n
  To get a Distribution Map for a particular "Name":#name, you go to the page
  for that Name (e.g., through putting the name in the search box and clicking
  'Name') and then clicking the 'Distribution Map' link near the top of the
  page.
  \n\n
  "Users":#user can add to the Distribution Map for a Name.  The easiest way is
  when you create a new "Observation":#observation, use an already defined
  Location.  The auto-completion for the 'Where' field will list all Locations
  that are currently being used whether they are defined or not.
  \n\n
  You can also explicitly choose not to have an Observation show up on the
  Distribution Map.  This allows you to record Observations of mushrooms in
  places like mushroom fairs, grocery stores or other places where you may not
  know where the mushroom was actually collected.  When creating or editing an
  Observation there is a checkbox labeled 'Is Collection Location'.  By default
  it is checked.  If you uncheck it, then that Observation will not get put on
  the Distribution Map.
  \n\n
  When looking at Observations, defined Locations will be followed with 'Click
  for map'.  Undefined Locations will be followed with 'Search'.  If you click
  on the link for an undefined Location, it will do a search for Observations
  that have that value in the 'Where' field.  The resulting page will include
  links at the top to 'Define This Location' or 'Merge With A Defined
  Location'.
  \n\n
  Clicking a 'Define This Location' link will take you to a page where you can
  create that Location.  The first thing to review is the name of the Location.
  You are strongly encouraged to end each Location with country.  In the USA
  you are also encouraged to include the full state name along with the county.
  Abbreviations are discouraged with the exception of 'Co.' for County.  Thus a
  good name is **Salt Point State Park, Sonoma Co., California, USA** and a bad
  name would be **Salt Point, CA**.
  \n\n
  For other countries, I don't know enough to propose a concrete proposal, so I
  expect conventions will evolve over time.
  \n\n
  Locations are currently defined as a box that completely encloses the named
  location.  Part of intention with making the Locations an area rather than a
  single GPS reading is to not force people to reveal their 'spots' while still
  getting something that is at least accurate to the county.  To define a
  Location you enter the extreme north and south latitudes as well as the
  extreme east and west longitudes for that location.  To help find the
  latitudes and longitudes, there are links to a couple of location finder
  pages near the center of each location creation/editing pages.  These will
  open in a separate window or tab.  You can then search for or navigate to the
  Location on the map and read off the position.
  \n\n
  In addition to the position of the Location, you can also provide a maximum
  and minimum altitude along with some notes if you have them.  Note that the
  altitudes should be in meters not feet.  Once you have filled out the form,
  click 'Create' to define the Location.  It does a bit of sanity checking to
  make sure that the values are reasonable and that the name of the Location is
  unique.  An existing Location can be edited by going to the page for that
  Location and clicking 'Edit'.  Anyone can change the information for a
  Location, but previous versions of the map information is kept as a reference
  to allow easy recovery if someone puts in the wrong information.
  \n\n
  You can get a list of all Locations in use by clicking the "All
  Locations":/location/list_place_names link from any of the Location related
  pages.  This page lists both the defined Locations (on the left, sorted
  alphabetically) and the undefined Locations (on the right, sorted by the
  number of Observations associated with that Location).  One really helpful
  way to contribute to the site is by clicking on the undefined Locations and
  defining them starting with the ones that are in the most widespread use.  In
  some cases the same Location has been given multiple names (e.g., 'Point
  Reyes National Seashore' and 'Pt Reyes Park').  You can merge an undefined
  Location with a defined Location by clicking the 'Merge' link next to the
  undefined Location.  When you click a 'Merge' link it will do a quick search
  for any likely candidates and present those in one list and all the remaining
  Locations in another in case it guessed wrong.  Clicking on any of those
  Location links will perform the merge.
  \n\n
  In theory it would be possible for the same Location to be defined more than
  once (presumably by different people).  If this happens, you can propose a
  merge by editing one of the Locations and change the 'Where' field to the
  value of the other Location.  This will not have any immediate effect, but a
  warning will be given and an email will be sent to the site administrators
  with the details.  Merging defined Locations is restricted since it could
  cause significant data loss.

how_name:  >
  *Name* - A name for some group of mushrooms.  Most commonly this is the name
  of a species, but it can be any taxon (genus, family, variety, etc.).  Names
  can also refer to groups that are not officially recognized scientific names
  such as common names or functional groups like Gasteromyces.  A Name is *not*
  considered to be owned by a particular "User":#user.  Any User may change a
  Name, but all changes are associated with a User and are reviewed by the
  community.  To help with this review process, copies of previous versions of
  a Name are kept.  Names can have an acknowledged author.  The author is
  normally only given for scientific names.  The author should follow the
  standard practice of listing the person who first correctly published the
  name.  In the case of Names at or below the species level, the author may
  also include the person who transfered the species to the current genus,
  e.g., (Singer) Jenkins.

how_observation:  >
  *Observation* - A record of a single mushroom species at a particular time
  and "Location":#location seen by a particular "User":#user.  Typically
  associated with one or more "Names":#name along with some number of
  "Images":#image, "Comments":#comment and "Species Lists":#species_list.  A
  given Observation is owned by a particular User.  An Observation can only be
  edited or deleted by the owner or a site administrator.

how_projects:  >
  *Projects* - Projects are a way for a group of "Users":#user to work together
  to create a set of work that they want to keep out of the public eye until
  they are ready to publish it.  The original purpose was to support university
  classes where there was a desire to keep a more controlled environment while
  the class was going.  Projects are also intended to support groups working on
  publications and other similar focused efforts.
  \n\n
  Anyone can create a new Project by clicking on "List
  Projects":/project/list_projects in the left-handle panel and then clicking
  'Add Project'.  The person who creates the Project is always a member and and
  an administrator for that Project.  An administrator for a Project can add
  new members by clicking the 'Add Members' link at the top of a Project's
  'Show Project' page.  Administrators can also make other Users administrators
  for the Project by going to one of the 'Change Status' links available on the
  'Show Project' or 'Add Members' pages.  Any User can send requests to the
  admins for a Project.  These requests get emailed to the admins and contain a
  link for changing that User's status.
  \n\n
  Currently the primary focus of Projects is creating draft description pages
  for fungal species.  You can create a new draft by going to the current
  description page for a species and clicking the appropriate Project under
  "Create New Draft for".  Note that you must be a member of a Project to
  create a draft description for that Project.  Once you have completed a
  draft, you can publish the draft by clicking "Publish Draft" on the "Show
  Draft" page.  You must click "Destroy Draft" to remove a draft from a
  Project.  At the moment (Oct. 2008) only one draft can exist for a given
  species.  This limitation is expected to go away by the end of Oct. 2008.

how_proposed_name:  >
  *Proposed Name* - A "Name":#name as "proposed":#proposing_names for a given
  "Observation":#observation.  Any number of Names may be proposed for a single
  Observation by members of the community.  No special treatment is given to
  any member's Name.  Community consensus is arrived at through the process of
  "voting":#voting.  Each proposed Name for an Observation is owned by a single
  "User":#user.  However, even the User who proposed the Name cannot
  necessarily modify or delete a Name once other members of the community have
  cast "Votes":#vote for or against it.  Fortunately you may always propose
  additional Names.  There is never any sort of penalty associated with
  proposing incorrect Names.

how_proposing_names:  >
  *Proposing Names* - Members of the community are now allowed to directly
  propose new "Names":#name for any "Observations":#observation.  Click on an
  Observation (e.g., from the Activity Log) and scroll down to below the
  Observation notes.  There should be a list of "Proposed Names":#proposed_name
  enclosed in a thin black outline.  Most Observations will already have at
  least one Proposed Name (by the owner).  From here you may either click on
  'Propose New Name' or "Vote on":#voting existing Names.  In either case you
  will have to log in before you are allowed to do so.
  \n\n
  When you click on 'Propose Another Name' you will be presented with a form
  much like the one used to create an Observation.  In addition to the Name,
  you are required to choose a confidence level.  This is your "Vote":#vote,
  and you may change it on the Show Observation page at
  any time you like.  As with creating an Observation, you are strongly
  encouraged to give some explanation as to why you think your Name applies to
  this Observation (and the others don't).  When you are finished, click
  'Create'.  You will be given a chance to correct typos or to choose an
  accepted Name if you entered a deprecated one.
  \n\n
  As a general rule, Users are discouraged from proposing a Name if someone
  else has already done so.  The only reason to do so would be to describe
  alternative reasons for reaching the same conclusion.  Instead use the
  discussion forum provided by "Comments":#comment to do this.

how_searching:  >
  *Searching* - There are two interesting ways to search for information in the
  site.  The simplest is to type a search string into the Search Box near the
  top of each page and click one of the buttons next to Search Box.  This will
  give you a list of all the "Observations":#observation, "Images":#image,
  "Names":#name or "Locations":#location that contain fields matching the given
  string.
  \n\n
  You can also browse all the Names currently in the database by clicking on
  the 'Name Index' link on the left-side of the screen.  It is now possible to
  "propose multiple Names":#proposing_names for a given Observation.  This
  means when you browse through the Name Index, it lists all Observations for
  which that Name has been proposed.  However, for example, the genus
  **__Agaricus__** only lists those Observations that are in the genus, but
  have not been identified to species.  It does not list all the Observations
  that have been given the Name of a species within that genus.  On the other
  hand, if two Names are considered synonyms, then you can access Observations
  for either from their Name Page.  In the case of the Search Box, if you give
  'Agaricus' then all Observations whose Name contains that string are listed
  so you get all Observations that belong to that genus.

how_species_list:  >
  *Species List* - A list of "Observations":#observation (not "Names":#name).
  Includes a date, a "Location":#location and a title for the list.  A given
  Species List is owned by a particular "User":#user.  Only the owner or a site
  administrator can change or delete a Species List.  There are no strict rules
  for how Species Lists should be used.  This is an area that is likely to
  change in the future as the community comes up with clearer ideas for how
  they should get used.

how_title:  How to Use Mushroom Observer
how_tracking_species:  >
  *Tracking a Particular Species or Genus Through Email* - Mushroom Observer
  allows you to request an email any time a particular "Name":#name is given to
  an "Observation":#observation.  If that Name is a genus or species it will
  also send you an email whenever a species or subspecies is observed.  To turn
  this on for a particular Name, go to the page for that Name (see
  "Searching":#searching) and click 'Email Tracking'.  By default the person
  who made the Observation that was given that Name will be sent an email to
  let them know you are interested in their Observation.  You can customize
  your request to the observer.  If you don't provide any instructions, then
  they will not be sent an email.  If the observer gives the Name at the time
  the Observation is created, they will be shown your message immediately
  through the website.  You can modify or disable your request for a particular
  Name by going back to that Name and again selecting 'Email Tracking' and
  clicking the 'Disable' button on the page that comes up.

how_unknown_help:  >
  *Getting Help with an Unknown* - In order to get help with an unknown, you
  need to have a "User":#user account.  These can be created easily by
  selecting 'Create Account' from the left-hand panel.  See the discussion of
  Users below for more details.
  \n\n
  Once you are logged in, create a new "Observation":#observation by selecting
  'Create Observation' from the left-hand panel.  Put all the details you can
  into the resulting form.  You can leave the 'What' field blank or call it
  'Unknown', or if you think you know the genus or family or other group, give
  that "Name":#name followed by 'sp.', e.g., 'Russula sp.'.  In the 'Notes'
  field provide information about habitat, odor, smell and anything else not
  clear from the photos.  Once the form is as complete as you can make it,
  click 'Create'.
  \n\n
  You should now be looking at a page showing you the information you just
  entered.  However, if you used a Name that is not currently in the database,
  you will be asked if you want to add the Name.  This also gives you a chance
  to catch and fix typos.  In addition, if you use a Name that is considered
  deprecated, you will be given the option to use a preferred synonym.
  \n\n
  Once you have created the new Observation, you can upload any "Images":#image
  you have by selecting the 'Add Image' link on the right-side of the window.
  It is very important that it be either an Image you took or that you have the
  explicit permission of the person who created the Image to upload it to the
  site.  If you did not take the Image, please update the 'Copyright Holder'
  field to reflect the actual owner.  This page also allows you to select the
  "License":#license you want to release the Image under.
  \n\n
  When you add unknowns, the community will generally "propose one or more
  Names":#proposing_names for it within 24-hours.  If you find any of the
  suggested Names compelling, you should not hesitate to revisit your
  Observation and "Vote":#vote on them.  Please see the discussion below on
  "voting":#voting, as well.  Members of the community may also post feedback
  via "Comments":#comment.  By default your "Account":#user is set up to
  deliver Comments posted about your Observations to you by email.  If you are
  asked to provide more details on the collection, it is considered better to
  select 'Edit' and add them to the 'Notes' field than to just add another
  Comment.

how_user:  >
  *User* - An account on MushroomObserver.org created by someone.  You are
  required to provide a valid email address when you first create an account.
  This allows the system to stop automated programs from creating bogus
  accounts.  It also provides a way for other Users to get in touch with you.
  However, your email address will never be revealed unless you request an
  email be sent to another User and then only to that User.  If you are
  concerned about having your email address in the MushroomObserver.org
  database, once you have verified your account, you can go to the Preferences
  page and remove your address.

how_vote:  >
  *Vote* - One "User's":#user Vote on a "Proposed Name":#proposed_name for a
  given "Observation":#observation.  Expresses a level of confidence or
  agreement with that Name, with half the choices ("[min_pos_vote]" and up)
  being positive and half ("[min_neg_vote]" and below) being negative.  Votes
  are owned by that User, and can only be changed or deleted by the owner or a
  site administrator.

how_voting:  >
  *Voting on Proposed Names* - Click on an "Observation":#observation, e.g.,
  from the Activity Log, and scroll down to the Proposed Names
  box.  Note that you must login before you can see or change any of your
  "Votes":#vote.  Once you have logged in, you should see pulldown menus next
  to each "Proposed Name":#proposed_name.  Your Vote expresses the degree of
  confidence or agreement you have with placing that Name on that Observation.
  Everything above "[min_neg_vote]" is considered a positive Vote, everything
  below "[min_pos_vote]" negative.  Choose "[no_opinion]" to tell it to delete
  your Vote altogether.  When you've changed all the Votes you want to, be sure
  to click on 'Update Votes' to record your Votes.  Don't worry, if you forget
  and try to navigate away without casting your Votes it will complain (unless
  you have Javascript disabled).
  \n\n
  Votes for a Name are summed and then divided by the number of Votes for that
  Name + 1.  This ends up favoring Names with more Votes, so vote early and
  often!  The Name with the highest score wins, and by default that Name will
  be applied to that Observation throughout the site.  In the case where
  multiple synonyms are proposed for an Observation it lumps the Votes
  together, choosing each User's strongest Vote within that group of synonyms.
  In the end, assuming that group of synonyms wins, the currently accepted Name
  is used as the community consensus.  If there is still debate in the
  scientific community about which Name is appropriate for a given taxon, then
  it will use Votes the best it can to decide between multiple accepted Names.
