intro_purpose: >
  <p><b>Propósito:</b> O propósito deste site é registrar observações de 
  cogumelos, ajudar pessoas a identificar cogumelos que lhes são familiar e 
  expandir a comunidade de exploração científica de cogumelos (micologia). 
  Alguns perguntam o que é considerado cogumelo. Este site tem uma visão bem 
  ampla. Mesmo com ênfase em fungos carnudos e grandes, outros fundos como 
  líquens, uredinales e mofos, assim como organismos parecidos com fungos como 
  mofo-limo são bem-vindos. Últimamente eu tenho esperado que este site se 
  torne uma fonte valiosa de conhecimento tanto para micologistas amadores 
  como para profissionais. Eu gosto de pensar nele como um guia vivo de 
  cogumelos ou como um jornal colaborativo sobre cogumelos.
  </p><p>
  Para os iniciantes na micologia, existe um grande montante de pesquisas 
  básicas que precisam ser feitas. As estimativas são de que menos de 5% das 
  espécies de fungos do planeta são conhecidos pela ciência. Enquanto as coisas 
  são ligeiramente melhores para os grandes e carnudos fungos conhecidos como 
  cogumelos, continua sendo comum a experiência de cruzar cogumelos que não 
  são facilmente identificáveis nos livros disponíveis ou que simplesmente não 
  combinam completamente com a definição de qualquer espécie catalogada. Este 
  site tem o intuito de preencher essa lacuna criando um lugar para 
  discutirmos e registrarmos o que encontramos, bem como nos conectar à 
  corrente literatura sobre cogumelos. Por favor, não se sinta intimidado pela 
  encurvatura ciêntifica do site. Todos são bem-vindos a compartilhar suas 
  próprias observações, colocar suas fotos e a fazer comentários nas 
  observações de outras pessoas.</p>

how_adding_comments: >
  <p><b>Adding Comments</b> - When you are looking at an
  <a href="#observation">Observation</a> you select the 'Add Comment' link near
  the top of the page.  If you are not currently logged into a <a href="#user">User</a>
  account, you will be asked to log in.  Once you are logged in, you will be given a
  form asking for a Summary and your Comment.  Note that you can do some simple
  formating in the Comment section.  This is briefly documented below the Comment
  section with a link to detailed documentation.  You can also add links within a
  Comment using standard HTML formatting.  The HTML gets automatically cleaned to
  avoid security problems like script injection, so try not to get too fancy.</p>

# lu
how_adding_observations: >
  <p><b>Adding Observations You Have Identified</b> - Use the same process as 'Getting
  Help with an Unknown', except you provide your identification in the 'What' field.  You
  are strongly encouraged to say something about how you arrived at the identification.
  We've provided a small set of checkboxes to make this easy (e.g.  'Identified by
  sight', 'Based on microscopic features'), but you are encouraged to elaborate on them
  in the provided text fields (e.g. list the references you used, or say 'sequenced the
  DNA and compared it against the data in GenBank').  Community members will often post
  <a href="#comment">Comments</a> if there is some question about the collection or they
  would like clarification as to why you ruled out other <a href="#name">Names</a>.</p> 

# lu
how_comment: >
  <p><b>Comment</b> - A User's comment on a particular Observation.  Comments are the
  standard way to discuss an Observation or its associated Images.  A given Comment
  is owned by a particular User.  A Comment can only be edited or deleted by the owner
  or a site administrator.  You can look up all Comments that have been made about
  Observations you own by clicking 'Comments for You' from the left-hand panel.</p>

# lu
how_common_tasks: Common Tasks

# lu
how_creating_species_lists: >
  <p><b>Creating Species Lists</b> - Select 'Create List' from the left-hand panel.  Fill
  out the various fields.  In the 'Species' field, you should give each species a <a
  href="#name">Name</a> on a line by itself.  When you go to create the <a
  href="#species_list">Species List</a> each line will be checked to see if there is a
  match in the database.  If there is no matching <a href="#name">Name</a>, then you will
  be asked if you want to add the unknown names to the database.  This gives you a chance
  to catch and fix typos as well as a simple way to add missing names.  Each name given
  in the 'Species' field or loaded from a file will create a completely new observation.
  The 'Species List Notes' are only shown when the entire species list is shown.  The
  'Notes for each new member' are actually added as the 'Notes' field to each newly
  created <a href="#observation">Observation</a>.</p> 
  <p>If you wish to collect a set of existing <a href="#observation">Observations</a> into
  a new list, first create an empty Species List.  Then go to each of the Observations you
  want to add and select 'Manage Species Lists'.  This will given you the opportunity to add
  that Observation to any Species Lists you have created.</p>
  <p>If you visit another Species List before you create or edit another one, you will
  automatically get a checklist of species from the first list to select and add to the
  list you are creating or editing.</p>

how_image: >
  <p><b>Image</b> - A photograph or illustration of one or more mushroom species.  Images
  are associated with one or more Observations.  A given Image is owned by a particular
  User who may or may not be the copyright holder.  Only the owner or a site administrator
  can remove an Image or edit the associated information.  All Images in the site are required
  to be released under one of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons licenses</a>.
  If you dispute the given copyright or the licensing of an image you are the copyright holder of,
  send mail to the "webmaster":%s.</p>

# lu
how_intro: >
  This page provides a some short descriptions of common uses for the site followed by an
  overview of basic concepts used in the website.

# lu
how_keeping_up: >
  <p><b>Keeping Up with Changes</b> - The default page for MushroomObserver.org is the
  'Activity Log', it is also accessible through the 'Latest Changes' link on the left
  side of the screen.  This page lets you know what the most recent changes to the site
  are.  It lists new <a href="#observation">Observations</a> and
  <a href="#species_list">Species Lists</a> as well as significant changes to any already
  existing ones.  Additions of <a href="#image">Images</a> or <a href="#comment">Comments</a>
  are considered significant changes to the relevant <a href="#observation">Observations</a>.
  Changes to <a href="#name">Names</a> are also listed.  The numbers at the top and bottom
  of the page let you look through older changes.  <a href="#observation">Observations</a>
  and <a href="#name">Names</a> created as a side effect of other changes are not separately
  listed.</p>
  <p>In addition, the latest changes can be tracked using the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss_feed">RSS feed</a> provided by the site.</p>

# lu
how_license: >
  <p><b>License</b> - Images on the Mushroom Observer website are put under an explicit license.
  The current options are the
  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution, Share Alike License</a>
  and the
  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution, Non-Commercial, Share Alike License</a>.
  The primary difference is whether the image can be used in any potentially commercial setting.
  One of the side effects of selecting the non-commercial license is that your image cannot be
  used on Wikipedia.  The license can be set on a per image basis.  The looser, Wikipedia
  compatible license is the default for new users.  However, you can select the non-commercial
  license to be your default by selecting it on your Preferences page and clicking 'Save'.</p>

# lu
how_name: >
  <p><b>Name</b> - A name for some group of mushrooms.  Most commonly this is the name of a species,
  but it can be any taxon (genus, family, variety, etc.).  Names can also refer to groups that are
  not officially recognized scientific names such as common names or functional groups like Gasteromyces.
  A Name is <em>not</em> considered to be owned by a particular User.  Any User may change a Name, but
  all changes are associated with a User and are reviewed by the community.  To help with this review
  process, copies of previous versions of a Name are kept.  Names can have an acknowledged author.
  The author is normally only given for scientific names.  The author should follow the standard
  practice of listing the person who first correctly published the name.  In the case of names at
  or below the species level, the author may also include the person who transfered the species to
  the current genus, e.g., (Singer) Jenkins.</p>

# lu
how_observation: >
  <p><b>Observation</b> - A record of a single mushroom species at a particular time and
  place seen by a particular person.  Typically associated with one or more Names along with
  some number of Images, Comments and Species Lists.  A given Observation is owned by a
  particular User.  An Observation can only be edited or deleted by the owner or a site
  administrator.</p>

how_proposed_name: >
  <p><b>Proposed Name</b> - A name as proposed for a given Observation.  Any number of
  names may be proposed for a single observation by members of the community.  No special
  treatment is given to any member's name.  Community consensus is arrived at through
  the process of voting.  Each proposed name for an observation is owned by a single user.
  However, even the user who proposed the name cannot necessarily modify or delete a name
  once other members of the community have cast votes for or against it.  Fortunately you
  may always propose additional names.  There is never any sort of penalty associated with
  proposing incorrect names.</p>

how_proposing_names: >
  <p><b>Proposing Names</b> - Members of the community are now allowed to directly propose new
  <a href="#name">Names</a> for other user's <a href="observation">Observations</a>.  Click on
  an observation (e.g. from the Activity Log) and scroll down to below the observation notes.
  There should be a list of names enclosed in a thin black outline. Most observations will already
  have at least one name proposed (by the owner).  From here you may either click on 'Propose New
  Name' or vote on existing names.  In either case you will have to log in before you are allowed
  to do so.</p>
  <p>When you click on 'Propose New Name' you will be presented with a form much like the one used
  to create an observation.  In addition to the name, you are required to choose a confidence level.
  This is your <a href="#vote">Vote</a>, and you may change it on the Show Observation page at any
  time you like.  And as with creating an observation, you are strongly encouraged to give some
  explanation as to why you think your name applies to this observation (and the others don't).
  When you are finished, click 'Create'.  You will be given a chance to correct typos or to choose
  an accepted name if you typed in a deprecated one.</p>
  <p>As a general rule, users are discouraged from proposing a name if someone else has
  already done so.  The only reason to do so would be to describe alternative reasons for
  reaching the same conclusion.  Instead use the discussion forum provided by comments to
  do this.</p>

# lu
how_searching: >
  <p><b>Searching</b> - There are two interesting ways to search for information in the site.
  The simplest is to type a search string into the Search Box near the top of each page and
  click one of the buttons next to Search Box.  This will give you a list of all the
  <a href="#observation">Observations</a>, <a href="#image">Images</a>, <a href="#name">Names</a>
  or <a href="#location">Locations</a> that contain fields matching the given string.</p>
  <p>You can also browse all the names currently in the database by clicking on the
  'Name Index' link on the left-side of the screen.  It is now possible to propose multiple
  <a href="#name">Names</a> for a given <a href="#observation">Observation</a>.
  This means when you browse through the Name Index, it lists all observations for which that
  name has been proposed.  However, for example, the genus <i>Agaricus</i> only lists those
  observations that are in the genus, but have not been identified to species.  It does
  not list all the observations that have been given the name of a species within that
  genus.  On the other hand, if two <a href="#name">Names</a> are considered synonyms, then you can
  access observations for either from their Name Page.  In the case of the Search Box, if
  you give 'Agaricus' then all observations whose name contains that string are listed so
  you get all observations that belong to that genus.</p>

# lu
how_species_list: >
  <p><b>Species List</b> - A list of Observations.  Includes a date, a location and a
  title for the list.  A given Species List is owned by a particular User.  Only the
  owner or a site administrator can change or delete a Species List.  There are no
  strict rules for how Species Lists should be used.  This is an area that is likely
  to change in the future as the community comes up with clearer ideas for how lists
  should get used.</p>

# lu
how_title: How to Use Mushroom Observer

# lu
how_unknown_help: >
  <p><b>Getting Help with an Unknown</b> - In order to get help with an unknown, you need to
  have a <a href="#user">User</a> account.  These can be created easily by selecting
  'Create Account' from the left-hand panel.  See the discussion of <a href="#user">Users</a>
  below for more details.</p>
  <p>Once you are logged in, create a new <a href="#observation">Observation</a> by
  selecting 'Create Observation' from the left-hand panel.  Put all the details you can
  into the resulting form.  You can leave the 'What' field blank or call it 'Unknown', or
  if you think you know the genus or family or other group, give that name followed by
  'sp.', e.g. <i>Russula</i> sp.  In the 'Notes' field provide information about habitat,
  odor, smell and anything else not clear from the photos.  Once the form is
  as complete as you can make it, click 'Create'.</p>
  <p>You should now be looking at a page showing you the information you just entered.
  However, if you used a name that is not currently in the database, you will be asked if
  you want to add the name.  This also gives you a chance to catch and fix typos.  In
  addition, if you use a name that is considered deprecated, you will be given the option
  to use a preferred synonym.</p> 
  <p>Once you have created the new observation, you can upload any images you have by
  selecting the 'Add Image' link on the right-side of the window.  It is very important
  that it be either an image you took or that you have the explicit permission of the
  person who created the image to upload it to the site.  If you did not take the image,
  please update the 'Copyright Holder' field to reflect the actual owner.  This page also
  allows you to select the <a href="#lic">license</a> you want to release the image
  under.</p> 
  <p>When you add unknowns, the community will generally propose one or more <a
  href="#name">Names</a> for it within 24-hours.  If you find any of the suggested names
  compelling, you should not hesitate to revisit your observation and vote on them.
  Please see the discussion below on <a href="#vote">voting</a>, as well.  Members of the
  community may also post feedback via <a href="#comment">Comments</a>.  By default your
  <a href="#user">Account</a> is set up to deliver comments posted about your <a
  href="#observation">Observations</a> to you by email.  If you are asked to provide more
  details on the collection, it is considered better to select 'Edit' and add them to the
  'Notes' field than to just add another comment.</p> 

# lu
how_user: >
  <p><b>User</b> - An account on MushroomObserver.org created by someone.  You are required
  to provide a valid email address when you first create an account.  This allows the system
  to stop automated programs from creating bogus accounts.  It also provides a way for other
  people to get in touch with you.  However, your email address will never be revealed unless
  you request an email be sent to another User and then only to that User.  If you are
  concerned about having your email address in the MushroomObserver.org database, once you
  have verified your account, you can go to the Preferences page and remove your address.</p>

how_vote: >
  <p><b>Vote</b> - One user's vote on a proposed name for a given observation.  Expresses
  a level of confidence or agreement with that name, with half the choices ("%s" and up)
  being positive and half ("%s" and below) being negative.  If you vote "%s" on one of the
  names for a given observation, mushroomobserver.org will use that name whenever it
  refers to that observation.  Note that you can only vote this way for one of the names for
  a given observation.  Votes are owned by that user, and can only be changed or deleted by
  the owner or a site administrator.</p>

how_voting: >
  <p><b>Voting on Proposed Names</b> - Click on an observation, e.g. from the Activity Log,
  and scroll down to the proposed names box.  Note that you must login before you can
  see or change any of your votes.  Once you have logged in, you should see pulldown menus
  next to each proposed name.  Your vote expresses the degree of confidence or agreement
  you have with placing that name on that observation.  Everything above "%s" is considered
  a positive vote, everything below "%s" negative.  Choose "%s" to tell it to delete your
  vote altogether.  When you've changed all the votes you want to, be sure to click on
  'Update Votes' to record
  your votes.  Don't worry, if you forget and try to navigate away without casting your
  votes it will complain (unless you have Javascript disabled).</p>
  <p>Votes for a name are summed and then divided by the number of votes for that name + 1.
  This ends up favoring names with more votes, so vote early and often!  The name with
  the highest score wins, and by default that name will be applied to that observation
  throughout the site.  In the case where multiple synonyms are proposed for an observation
  it lumps the votes together, choosing each user's strongest vote within that group of
  synonyms.  In the end, assuming that group of synonyms wins, the currently accepted name
  is used as the community consensus.  If there is still debate in the scientific community
  about which name is appropriate for a given taxon, then it will use votes the best it
  can to decide between multiple accepted names.</p>
  <p>If you have a particularly strong preference for one of the names, vote "%s".  The
  website will attach that name to that observation wherever you go.</p>

# observer/how_to_use
how_describing_species: >
  <p><b>Describing Species</b> - Select "Index A->Z":%s from the left-hand panel and select a
  name or click any "About [name]..." link you see.  Read over any notes that already
  exist for that name.  If you know anything else about this species you want included, click 'Edit Name'
  and add your notes.  You are encouraged to cite references including field guides and
  scientific paper.  Short quotes from references are fine, but please don't make extensive
  quotes without checking with the permission of the original author.

how_location: >
  <p><b>Location</b> - A place in the world.  Defined Locations associate a location name with
  the extreme north and south latitudes and west and east longitudes of that location.  Defined Locations can also
  have a maximum and minimum altitude and notes.  Undefined Locations just have a name.  A Location
  is not considered to be owned by a particular User. Any User may change or define a Location, but all changes
  are associated with a User and are reviewed by the community. To help with this review process,
  copies of previous versions of a Location are kept.</p>

how_maps: >
  <p><b>Working with Maps</b> - Currently there are three types of maps available on Mushroom Observer: Distribution Maps (e.g.,
  "Distribution map for __Craterellus cornucopioides__":%s),
  Location Maps (e.g., "Salt Point State Park":%s) and the
  "Global Map":%s.</p>
  <p>To get a Distribution Map for a particular Name, you go to the page for that Name (e.g., through
  putting the name in the search box and clicking 'Name') and then clicking the 'Distribution Map'
  link near the top of the page.</p>
  <p>Users can add to the Distribution Map for a name. The easiest way is when you create a new observation,
  use an already defined location. The auto-completion for the Where field will list all locations that are
  currently being used whether they are defined or not.</p>
  <p>You can also explicitly choose not to have an observation show up on the Distribution Map.  This allows
  you to record observations of mushrooms in places like mushroom fairs, grocery stores or other places where 
  you may not know where the mushroom was actually collected.  When creating or editing an Observation there
  is a checkbox labeled 'Is Collection Location'. By default it is checked. If you uncheck it, then that observation
  will not get put on the Distribution Map.</p>
  <p>When looking at observations, defined locations will be followed with '[Click for map]'.  Undefined locations
  will be followed with '[Search]'.  If you click on the link for an undefined location, it 
  will do a search for observations that have that value in the where field. The resulting
  page will include links at the top to 'Define This Location' or 'Merge With A Defined Location'.</p>
  <p>Clicking a 'Define This Location' link will take you to a page where you can create that location. The first thing 
  to review is the name of the location. You are strongly encouraged to end each location with country. In the USA you are also
  encouraged to include the full state name along with the county. Abbreviations are discouraged with the exception of
  'Co.' for County. Thus a good name is **Salt Point State Park, Sonoma Co., California, USA** and a bad name is
  **Salt Point, CA**.</p>
  <p>For other countries, I don't know enough to propose a concrete proposal, so I expect conventions will evolve over time.</p>
  <p>Locations are currently defined as a box that completely encloses the named location. Part of intention with 
  making the locations an area rather than a single GPS reading is to not force people to reveal their 'spots' while still
  getting something that is at least accurate to the county. To define a location you enter the extreme north and south 
  latitudes as well as the extreme east and west longitudes for that location. To help find the latitudes and longitudes, there 
  are links to a couple of location finder pages near the center of each location creation/editing pages. These will open 
  in a separate window or tab. You can then search for or navigate to the location on the map and read off the position.</p>
  <p>In addition to the position of the location, you can also provide a maximum and minimum altitude along with some notes
  if you have them. Note that the altitudes should be in meters not feet. Once you have filled out the form, click 'Create'
  to define the location. It does a bit of sanity checking to make sure that the values are reasonable and that the name of the 
  location is unique. An existing location can be edited by going to the page for that location and clicking 'Edit'. Anyone can 
  change the information for a location, but the previous version of the information is kept as a reference to allow easy recovery 
  if someone puts in the wrong information.</p>
  <p>You can get a list of all locations in use by clicking the "All Locations":%s link from any 
  of the location related pages. This page lists both the defined locations (on the left, sorted alphabetically) and the 
  undefined locations (on the right, sorted by the number of observations associated with that location).  One really helpful
  way to contribute to the site is by clicking on the undefined locations and defining them starting with the ones that 
  are in the most widespread use.  In some cases the same location has been given multiple names (e.g., 'Point Reyes National
  Seashore' and 'Pt Reyes Park').  You can merge an undefined name with a defined name by clicking the 'Merge' link next to
  the undefined name. When you click a 'Merge' link it will do a quick search for any likely candidates and present those in
  one list and all the remaining locations in another in case it guessed wrong. Clicking on any of those location links will 
  perform the merge.</p>
  <p>In theory it would be possible for the same location to be defined more than once (presumably by different people).
  If this happens, you can propose a merge by editing one of the locations and change the Where field to the value of the 
  other location. This will not have any immediate effect, but a warning will be given and an email will be sent to the
  site administrators with the details. Merging defined locations is restricted since that could cause significant data loss.</p>

how_tracking_species: >
  <p><b>Tracking a Particular Species Through Email</b> - Mushroom Observer allows you to
  request an email anytime a particular <a href="#name">Name</a> is given to an
  <a href="#observation">Observation</a>.  To turn this on for a particular Name, go to
  the page for that Name (see <a href="#searching">Searching</a>) and click 'Email Tracking'.
  By default the person
  who made the observation that was given that name will be sent an email to let them know
  you are interested in their observation.  You can customize your request to the observer.
  If you don't provide any instructions, then they will not be sent an email.  If the observer
  gives the name at the time the observation is created, they will be shown your message
  immediately through the website.  You can modify or disable your request for a particular
  Name by going back to that name and again selecting 'Email Tracking'.
